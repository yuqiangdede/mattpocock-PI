# Notarize the final macOS DMG with Apple's notary service, then staple its
# ticket. Run after electron-builder produced the DMG.
#
# Why this exists: electron-builder's `mac.notarize=true` notarizes the built
# `PI-Desktop.app` (so the app and the ZIP that carries it pass Gatekeeper and
# in-app updates work). The DMG is a separate artifact with its own signature,
# so it needs its own notarytool submission before it can be stapled. Stapling a
# DMG that was never submitted fails with:
#
#   CloudKit query ... failed due to "Record not found".
#   Could not find base64 encoded ticket
#   The staple and validate action failed! Error 65.
#
# Required environment (never echoed, never written to the repo):
#   APPLE_ID                      Apple ID email in team DUV63RKYTW
#   APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD   app-specific password for that Apple ID
#   APPLE_TEAM_ID                 must be DUV63RKYTW
#
# Usage: scripts/notarize-and-staple-macos-release-dmg.sh [release-dir]
