# Screens

Every frame below comes from the capture rig that backs the
[E2E test plan](/spec/06-delivery/04-e2e-test-plan): the app runs with
`PI_DESKTOP_CAPTURE=1` against a throwaway data directory, drives itself through
each surface, and writes the PNGs that `scripts/publish-screenshots.py` converts
for this page. The screenshots therefore show the shipped shell rather than a
mockup, including the empty states a fresh install starts from.

Session titles and transcripts come from the capture fixture, so the chrome is
English while the sample conversation is Chinese. The
[中文版本](/zh-CN/guide/screenshots) shows the same surfaces with Chinese chrome.

## Home and conversation

The home screen is the first surface a new install shows: a hero, the composer,
and the sidebar with sessions grouped by project.

A conversation streams into the transcript with a minimap rail on the right;
hovering the rail magnifies the markers and previews the message under the
cursor.

The Composer's model × reasoning chip switches the model for the session. In the
composer, `/` opens the command menu and `@` opens the file reference menu.

## Work panels

The work panel opens beside the conversation when the agent produces an
artifact. The frames below are the panels without an active workspace, which is
the state a conversation starts in.

## Destinations

Pull requests, the project archive, and scheduled tasks are full-page
destinations reached from the sidebar.

## Notifications and toasts

The notification inbox keeps a durable record of finished work, permission
requests, and update notices. Toasts cover the transient end of the same range.

## Global search

`⌘K` opens one dialog over sessions, pages, settings rows, and commands.
Choosing a settings hit navigates to the tab and flashes the row.

## Plugins

Installed plugins, the marketplace, and the package workflow live on the plugins
destination.

## Extensions

MCP servers, Skills, and Subagents are managed independently of plugins, each
with global or project-scoped activation.

Settings is a full-page destination with a searchable tab rail.

## Regenerating these frames

Build the renderer, make sure `target/debug/pi-desktop-host-core` exists, create
`/tmp/codex-screens`, then run the app once per locale and publish each pass:

```bash
pnpm --filter @pi-desktop/desktop build
mkdir -p /tmp/codex-screens

# English pass; append --lang=zh-CN for the Chinese pass.
cd apps/desktop && PI_DESKTOP_CAPTURE=1 PI_DESKTOP_DATA_DIR=$(mktemp -d) \
  ELECTRON_RENDERER_URL= ./node_modules/.bin/electron .

python3 scripts/publish-screenshots.py --source /tmp/codex-screens --locale en
```

The rig prints `CAPTURE_DONE` when the last scene is written.
