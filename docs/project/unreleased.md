# Unreleased changes

- Hosted web search now has a complete replay and estimation contract, including
  tool/Task continuation and restart recovery. Context rebuilding preserves
  system-prefix semantics, and structured local preparation failures no longer
  masquerade as retryable provider failures. Existing search histories need no migration.

- The Composer reasoning slider now moves smoothly to clicked or
  keyboard-selected levels, follows dragging immediately, and respects
  reduced-motion settings. Rapid clicks redirect the animation; failed saves
  restore the confirmed selection. Opening the menu no longer leaves a
  press-animation offset that jumps on the first selection.
- The reasoning slider's filled track covers the entire starting dot, so
  its left cap no longer leaves a gray half-dot exposed.
- Hovering a reasoning stop or its label highlights the corresponding label.
  Only unfilled dots brighten and enlarge; filled dots and the current thumb
  keep their appearance.
