# Remote Agent Control Rollout and Acceptance

- Status: Target delivery specification; post-MVP
- Decision: D373 / ADR 0205, amended by D376 and D377
- Normative protocol: `03-runtime/19-remote-agent-control-protocol.md`
- Normative security: `05-security/02-remote-control-security.md`

## 1. Delivery boundary and order

Remote control is a post-MVP capability. The current MVP continues to ship:

- Electron Main as the local orchestrator;
- Node pi sidecar as the Agent runtime;
- Rust host-core over local stdio NDJSON JSON-RPC;
- optional loopback-only MCP control under ADR 0203; and
- no public or LAN Gateway listener.

Remote work MUST NOT begin by exposing the existing host-core or IPC endpoint.
The implementation starts with the typebox contract, the headless Agent Host
module, and conformance tests, then adds transport bindings behind explicit
feature flags.

D377 fixes the order of the milestones around recorded demand rather than
around transport breadth:

- issues #176 and #140 ask to operate projects on a remote Linux or WSL
  machine from the local desktop, which is the SSH-tunnel remote Host
  topology;
- issue #100 asks for task completion and approval notifications on
  Telegram, WeChat, Slack, or a webhook, plus simple commands back, which is
  an outbound integration beside the Host; and
- no recorded request asks for a browser or phone client of the desktop, so
  the Gateway and browser milestones are unscheduled.

The scheduled order is R0, R1, R2, R3. Milestones marked unscheduled keep
their specifications so the contract does not drift, and they are scheduled
only by a later product decision.

## 2. Milestones

### R0 — Contract and test fixtures

Deliver:

- RACP v1 resource and operation schemas as typebox definitions in
  `packages/shared`, the single source of the contract, including the
  remote-host profile operations of protocol §6.2;
- generated JSON Schema fixtures and shared request/response/event traces;
- error mapping and capability negotiation fixtures;
- cursor, epoch, snapshot, idempotency, turn-queue, and approval
  state-machine tests, including `allow-session` and Plan/Goal
  permission-mode selection;
- binding-independent authorization test vectors, including the remote
  permission ceiling and the SSH-paired owner exemption; and
- threat model review against the security specification.

Exit criteria:

1. A fixture trace has an identical semantic result for every shipped
   binding adapter.
2. Duplicate, stale, expired, and unauthorized requests have deterministic
   outcomes.
3. No fixture requires direct host-core or renderer access.
4. No hand-written second copy of the contract exists.

### R1 — Headless Agent Host module

Deliver `packages/agent-host`, a module with no Electron dependency that
owns session and turn admission, the per-session turn queue, the approval
broker, the in-memory event log with epochs, and the snapshot builder
including active items and pending requests. Electron Main hosts it; the
existing IPC handlers become adapters over it, incrementally if needed. Two
local changes ship with it:

- Rust host-core exposes `permissions.pending` so a late-attaching client
  receives open requests; and
- the renderer's in-memory prompt queue is replaced by the Host-owned turn
  queue, so every client sees the same pending prompts.

A development-only loopback RACP-WS endpoint drives the module; it is not
reachable outside loopback or an explicit development tunnel.

Exit criteria:

1. A client can close and reopen without interrupting a turn.
2. A stale cursor or a new epoch results in a snapshot, not an invented event
   sequence.
3. Existing local renderer behavior and the local MCP control plane are
   unchanged, and the desktop's queued prompts now come from the Host queue.
4. The module's test suite runs without Electron.
5. A client that attaches during an open approval sees it in the snapshot and
   its decision closes the local desktop card.

Timing: the extraction starts after the release in flight ships, and each of
`permissions.pending`, the Host queue, and the module extraction lands as its
own commit, because the repository has concurrent sessions and 54 tests that
match `electron/main/index.ts` by source pattern and must be repointed.

### R2 — Remote Host over an SSH tunnel

Deliver the first remote topology (`02-architecture/05-remote-agent-control.md`
§5.2): the desktop as Remote Client of a headless Host on another machine.

Deliverables:

- the `pi-host` bundle: the module, the Node pi sidecar, and the platform's
  host-core binary, versioned with the desktop, bound to loopback, started
  and paired over the user's own SSH session;
- the desktop RACP client adapter in Electron Main under `lib/api.ts`, so the
  renderer needs no transport knowledge and a remote session renders like a
  local one;
- `RACP-WS` on the header profile over the forwarded port, with the loopback
  rule of security §5.1 and the device-token pairing of security §3.2;
- the remote-host profile operations (`session/configure`, `session/fork`,
  `session/rename`, `session/delete`, `session/compact`, `workspace/list`,
  `workspace/read`, `workspace/diff`) so mode, model, thinking level, and the
  work panel's files and diff work against the remote session; and
- the remote session ownership split of architecture §6.3, including the
  absence of desktop plugin tools and desktop MCP servers from remote
  sessions.

Design gate, answered before coding starts, with the recommended answers:

1. Provider configuration on the remote Host is written over the SSH
   bootstrap channel as Host-local configuration; nothing crosses RACP.
2. Desktop plugin tools and desktop user MCP servers are unavailable in
   remote sessions; a reverse tool relay stays reserved.
3. The work-panel terminal runs on the remote machine; it ships in R2 as a
   `terminal/*` streaming profile only if the desktop pty already runs
   outside the renderer with a stable contract, otherwise it moves to R2.1.
4. `pi-host` is distributed per platform at the desktop's version; a version
   mismatch is `PROTOCOL_MISMATCH`, and the desktop offers to update the
   remote bundle.
5. The SSH-paired desktop device holds `owner` and is exempt from the remote
   permission ceiling.

Exit criteria:

1. E2E-232 passes: a turn started from the desktop reads, writes, and runs
   commands on the remote machine only, approvals appear in the desktop card,
   and the remote host-core binds loopback only.
2. Dropping and restoring the SSH session mid-turn resumes by cursor without
   duplicating the turn.
3. Mode, model, and thinking-level changes on a remote session behave as
   locally, idle-only.
4. The remote tool catalog contains no desktop plugin tool.
5. A `pi-host` at another version is rejected and the update path is offered.

### R3 — Outbound messaging integration

Deliver the integration adapter beside the Host (issue #100): a further
caller of the module inside the Host process, with no transport and no
inbound listener.

- It subscribes to host-scope and session events and relays redacted
  summaries of `turn.completed`, `turn.failed`, `approval.requested`, and
  `input.requested` to outbound channels: webhook first, then Telegram and
  Slack through their outbound polling or socket modes; channels that require
  an inbound callback are deferred.
- It maps a fixed command vocabulary from a linked chat to `turn/start`,
  `turn/stop`, `turn/interrupt`, and `approval/respond`, executed under the
  linked principal's roles and the same Host policy as any client; unlinked
  chats are ignored and audited.
- It never blocks a turn: delivery failures are logged and retried with a
  bound, and the Host runs the same whether the adapter is configured or not.

Exit criteria: E2E-233 passes; payloads contain summaries and ids only;
commands from an unlinked chat have no effect; the Host has no new listener.

### Unscheduled — Gateway and Host link (formerly R3)

A separate Remote Gateway and the outbound Host link
(`racp-hostlink.v1`) with identity, routing, rate limits, audit, revocation,
and transient attachment relay. The identity source (OIDC/OAuth 2.0 provider
or first-party product account service) is recorded as a decision when this
milestone is scheduled. Exit criteria remain those of E2E-227.

### Unscheduled — Browser profile (formerly R4)

`RACP-HTTP` and the cookie authentication profile for browser clients on
both `RACP-WS` and SSE. Before it is scheduled, the browser client's first
needs are already covered by the remote-host profile (`session/configure`,
history, workspace reads); a Host-issued session cookie for Gateway-less use
still needs a specification clause. Exit criteria remain those of E2E-228.

### Reserved — gRPC binding (formerly R5)

`RACP-GRPC` is delivered only when a named native service consumer or
Gateway implementation needs it. Generate the `.proto` and clients from the
typebox source; do not maintain an independent hand-written gRPC contract.
It is not a release gate for remote control.

## 3. Implementation rules

### 3.1 Preserve the local path

The RACP server calls the headless Agent Host module, which calls the same
host and sidecar paths the renderer uses. It does not call the renderer,
`host.proxy`, or Rust host-core from a network listener. The `pi-host` bundle
runs the module and supervision on another machine without changing RACP.

### 3.2 Keep the Agent independent of clients

The Host owns active turns, the turn queue, and event cursors. Client
lifetime, browser tab lifetime, Electron window visibility, and SSH session
lifetime do not control Agent execution. A client must explicitly call
`turn/stop` or `turn/interrupt` to end a turn.

### 3.3 Keep the queue in the Host

Queued prompts are Host state. No client, including the local renderer,
keeps a private queue once the module ships; a queued turn is visible to
every attached client and can be canceled by any controller.

### 3.4 Keep the renderer transport-agnostic

The renderer reaches every backend through `lib/api.ts`. The desktop RACP
client adapter implements that surface for a remote Host; features the
remote-host profile does not cover are hidden by capability negotiation, not
stubbed. The renderer never learns whether a session is local or remote
beyond a display badge.

### 3.5 Make replay a first-class test surface

Every event-producing test records:

- the initial snapshot revision and cursor;
- the exact command and idempotency key;
- every durable event sequence applied;
- the disconnect point;
- the replay request; and
- the final snapshot hash.

The test fails if a duplicate, gap, out-of-order durable event, or
unannounced state change appears. Ephemeral events are excluded from ordering
assertions and must be reconstructible from the snapshot's active items.

### 3.6 Keep bindings semantically equal

The conformance fixture is the source of truth for behavior. Each shipped
binding may choose its native status and serialization, but it must preserve:

- operation acceptance and rejection;
- authorization scope and the remote permission ceiling;
- idempotency result;
- durable event order and cursor;
- queue order;
- approval lifecycle and decision vocabulary;
- attachment hash and size checks; and
- terminal turn state.

## 4. Validation plan

### 4.1 Unit and contract validation

- generated schema validation for every request, response, and event;
- state-machine transition tests for Session, Turn, turn queue, Approval,
  Input, and Attachment;
- idempotency tests with lost response and retry;
- cursor replay, epoch change, expiry, gap, and snapshot tests;
- authorization matrix tests for every role and operation, including the
  permission ceiling, its SSH-paired exemption, and `allow-session` policy;
- redaction tests for prompts, tool data, credentials, pending-request reads,
  integration payloads, and attachments; and
- generated binding round-trip tests.

### 4.2 Integration validation

- the headless module inside Electron Main with the real sidecar and
  host-core supervision;
- a `pi-host` bundle on a Linux test machine reached through an SSH port
  forward, including bootstrap, pairing, version mismatch, and re-pairing;
- the desktop adapter rendering a remote session through the unchanged
  renderer;
- SSH session drop and restore while a remote turn is running;
- host restart while a turn is running and turns are queued;
- the integration adapter against a webhook sink and a long-polling bot
  fixture; and
- when scheduled: Gateway routing across two Hosts, browser reconnect on the
  cookie profile, and the Host link relay through a NAT harness.

### 4.3 Security validation

- invalid, expired, revoked, and wrong-Host device tokens;
- non-loopback peers and non-loopback binds without TLS on a `pi-host`;
- pairing token reuse and pairing over a non-SSH channel;
- wrong role, wrong Session, wrong Host, and stale revision;
- SSRF and arbitrary file/path attempts, including `workspace/read` outside
  the session root;
- oversized and hash-mismatched uploads;
- prompt-injected requests attempting to select secrets or permissions;
- integration commands from unlinked chats and replayed commands;
- slow-reader and connection-exhaustion tests;
- audit-log redaction and retention checks; and
- when scheduled: Origin, CORS, CSRF, cookie, and Gateway relay checks.

### 4.4 Operational validation

Record at minimum:

- turn admission latency and queue depth;
- event delivery latency and sequence lag over the SSH forward;
- replay, resync, and epoch-change counts;
- approval wait time and expiry count;
- Host connection health, bootstrap duration, and version mismatches;
- authentication and authorization failures;
- integration delivery latency and retry counts;
- event queue drops, ephemeral and durable separately; and
- active Host/Session/client counts.

The first production target is a bounded, observable remote control service,
not an unbounded real-time stream. Load tests must demonstrate that a slow or
disconnected client does not affect Agent execution on either machine.

## 5. Rollout and rollback

1. Ship the typebox contract, generated fixtures, and disabled code paths
   first.
2. Enable R1 only in development profiles.
3. Enable the SSH-tunnel topology behind a feature flag for allowlisted test
   users, then generally.
4. Enable the integration adapter as an opt-in setting with no channel
   configured by default.
5. Schedule the Gateway, browser, and gRPC milestones only by a recorded
   product decision.
6. Keep a kill switch that rejects new remote connections and cancels queued
   turns submitted by remote principals while preserving already-running
   local desktop sessions.

Rollback MUST:

- stop accepting new remote connections and stop the integration adapter;
- leave a remote `pi-host` process running or stopped according to the
  user's choice, never deleting its transcripts;
- leave local stdio, renderer, and MCP paths usable;
- preserve completed local transcript data; and
- never replay a turn merely because a remote feature flag changed.

## 6. Release acceptance

The scheduled feature set is not production-ready until:

1. remote scenarios E2E-221 through E2E-226, E2E-229, E2E-230, and E2E-232
   are green in the approved remote harness, and E2E-233 for the integration
   adapter;
2. the security acceptance gates in
   `05-security/02-remote-control-security.md` that apply to the scheduled
   milestones are signed off;
3. a failure-injection run proves no duplicate execution after reconnect,
   including an SSH session drop;
4. `pi-host` bundles exist for every platform the desktop's release pipeline
   publishes for Linux, and the version-mismatch path is tested;
5. the Host operational metrics are available; and
6. a new release/rollback runbook names the feature flag, pairing revocation
   path, data retention on the remote machine, and incident owner.

Binding parity and E2E-227 / E2E-228 become gates when their milestones are
scheduled.

## 7. Amendment history

D376 (2026-09-10) replaced the Electron facade milestone with the headless
Agent Host module, added the Host queue and `permissions.pending` changes,
made `RACP-WS` the only normative v1 binding with a browser profile and a
reserved gRPC binding, added the Host link relay and identity-source
decision, and made tenant isolation tests conditional on a multi-tenant
harness.

D377 (2026-09-10) re-sequenced the milestones around recorded demand: R2 is
the SSH-tunnel remote Host with the desktop as client, R3 is the outbound
messaging integration, and the Gateway, browser, and gRPC milestones are
unscheduled. It added the R2 design gate, the `pi-host` bundle, the desktop
adapter rule, and E2E-232 / E2E-233 as the acceptance targets.
