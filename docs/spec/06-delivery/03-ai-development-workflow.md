## 1. Core Immutable Rules

The rules below govern every change to the PI-Desktop codebase and documentation. R1–R4 restate the five numbered Immutable Rules in `AGENTS.md` (R4 covers both the merge-back and worktree clean-up rules); R5 and R6 restate its GitHub issue and pull request handling sections. They cannot be relaxed by an agent without explicit human override.

### R1 — Spec-first / Spec-sync

> **No behavior change without updating the corresponding spec.**

- Every code, config, or UX change that alters observable behavior must update the relevant `docs/spec/` document before or alongside the change.
- Architectural boundary changes (process model, IPC contract, storage ownership, security boundary) also require an ADR — see `docs/adr/README.md`.
- Pure refactor that preserves behavior and API contracts does not require spec updates, but must still be committed (R2).

### R2 — Commit-per-change

> **Every completed logical change must be git committed.**

- No large uncommitted piles of work. Each logical unit of work — a feature, a fix, a spec update, a chore — gets its own commit.
- Uncommitted work at session end is a violation of this rule.
- If a change is incomplete, either commit it as a draft with a `WIP:` prefix or roll it back.

### R3 — E2E coverage doc

> **Every feature/fix that affects user-visible or protocol-visible behavior must update e2e test documentation.**

- "User-visible": anything the end-user sees or interacts with (UI, CLI output, dialogs, notifications).
- "Protocol-visible": IPC messages, RPC methods, plugin API surfaces, event payloads.
- Document the scenario in `06-delivery/04-e2e-test-plan.md` — even before the automated test exists.
- Internal-only changes (logging format, internal variable rename) do not require e2e doc updates.

### R4 — Request branch + worktree + merge gate

> **Every development request starts from `main` in a dedicated branch and
> worktree. A user request to commit or push includes completing the task's
> integration into `main` through the authorized delivery route.**

- Before editing, preserve any existing uncommitted work, fetch `origin/main`,
  fast-forward local `main` when its worktree is clean, and create a new request
  branch and worktree from that up-to-date commit. Existing work in the primary
  checkout must never be moved, stashed, or overwritten merely to start a new
  request.
- Use one short-lived branch per request. Name it
  `<type>/<short-description>`, where `type` matches the conventional change
  type when practical, for example `feat/provider-import` or
  `docs/request-branch-workflow`.
- Use one dedicated worktree per request. Do not implement a new request in the
  primary checkout or reuse another request's worktree.
- Reuse the primary checkout's development environment where safe: installed
  toolchains, package-manager stores, build caches, and ignored local
  environment configuration remain the canonical environment. Reference or
  link those resources into the request worktree when required; do not copy
  environment state into tracked files. Install or generate worktree-local
  state only when isolation or version compatibility requires it.
- Development commits and direct pushes on `main` are forbidden.
- A user request to commit, push, or both authorizes and requires integrating
  this task into local `main`. Do not stop after a task-branch commit or push,
  or ask for a second merge confirmation. Explicit branch-only or draft-only
  instructions override this completion target.
- A commit or local-merge request does not itself authorize remote publishing.
  If remote delivery has not been authorized, complete the required validation
  and merge into local `main` without pushing or opening a remote PR/MR.
- When a push or other remote delivery is authorized, the fixed delivery order
  applies: merge the request branch into local `main`, run the required E2E
  gate against that integrated commit (R7), and only then push the request
  branch, open a PR/MR targeting `main`, pass the required remote checks and
  reviews, and merge using a permitted strategy. Fetch and safely synchronize
  local `main` with the landed change. Do not infer permission to push directly
  to `main`, force-push, or discard unrelated local work.
- A code-bearing change is pushed for review, opened as a PR/MR, and merged
  remotely only after the request branch is merged into local `main` and the
  R7 gate has run against that integrated commit.
- Both routes retain the required validation, security, and conflict gates.
  Relevant E2E runs on the integrated local `main` before the request branch is
  pushed for review, under R7. If a gate, authentication, permissions, or
  required review prevents integration, report the actual blocker and remaining
  work; the requested integration is not Done.
- Worktree cleanup is mandatory and immediate. As soon as the request branch is
  integrated into `main` — including a local `main` merge when the request is
  delivered without a remote PR/MR — remove the worktree and delete the merged
  branch. A merged request must not leave a worktree on disk. Remove only your
  own worktree and branch, and only after verifying the merge commits are
  present in `main`.
- If the user requests a launch after delivery, build and start the app from
  the integrated `main` checkout and its development environment.

### R5 — Verify linked GitHub issues before work, then reply and close

> **A linked GitHub issue is not a task until the reported problem is shown to exist. After the outcome is conclusive, reply on that issue and close it.**

This rule applies when the user prompt includes a GitHub issue URL or an
unambiguous issue number for this repository.

- Fetch the issue (title, body, labels, comments, and state) before creating a
  worktree or changing files for the claimed problem.
- Independently verify the claim against the current codebase. For a bug,
  reproduce it or cite concrete code/spec evidence. For a feature or
  improvement, confirm the requested behavior is actually missing or incomplete
  and in scope.
- Do not start implementation until verification confirms the problem exists.
- If the problem does not exist (already fixed, invalid, or a
  misunderstanding): comment with the verification evidence and close the issue
  when that conclusion is clear. If verification is inconclusive, comment with
  what was tried and leave the issue open.
- If the problem exists: follow R4, implement the smallest coherent change,
  and after the request is merged into local `main`, comment with the
  resolution and close the issue.
- Write the GitHub comment in the language of the original issue title and
  body. Code, commits, specs, and other repository documentation stay English.
- An issue link authorizes commenting on and closing **that** issue only. It
  does not authorize a git push. Remote publishing remains opt-in per R4 and
  `AGENTS.md`.
- Do not comment on or close unrelated issues. Do not reopen a closed issue
  unless the user explicitly asks.

### R6 — Merge a linked pull request whose principle is sound, then follow up

> **A linked GitHub pull request whose direction is sound is merged first. Completeness, style, spec-sync, and polish happen after merge so the contributor's work is not discarded.**

This rule applies when the user prompt includes a GitHub pull request URL or
an unambiguous pull request number for this repository.

- Fetch the pull request (title, body, files, commits, comments, checks, draft
  state, base/head, and linked issues) before creating a replacement
  implementation or requesting a rewrite.
- Independently judge whether the **principle** is sound. The change must
  address a real, in-scope problem, and the approach must be compatible with
  the baseline, security boundaries, and architecture (or be a justified
  spec-backed amendment). Judge the direction, not whether the pull request
  already satisfies R1–R5 completeness.
- Do not reimplement the pull request as a replacement, close it for nits, or
  ask the contributor to start over when the principle is sound.
- If the principle is sound:
  1. Merge **that** pull request first, preserving the contributor's commits.
     Use a repository-permitted merge strategy that keeps the contributor as
     author of the landed work.
  2. Missing additional test coverage, documentation, naming cleanup,
     formatting, and other non-blocking polish are follow-up work. Build,
     typecheck, relevant existing test, required E2E, security, data-safety,
     protocol-compatibility, and merge-conflict failures remain landing
     blockers.
  3. Landing blockers that would break `main` (the change does not compile,
     fails existing tests for the changed area, or has merge conflicts) may
     receive the smallest commits **on top of** the author's work so the pull
     request can land. Do not squash away the author. Do not rewrite the
     design.
  4. After the pull request is in `main`, follow R4 for any follow-up
     improvements from the updated `main`.
  5. Comment on the pull request in its language: acknowledge the
     contribution, state what was merged, and list follow-up if any.
- If the principle is not sound, or a harm blocker exists (secrets, sandbox
  or privilege bypass, malicious or clearly destructive changes, out-of-scope
  reversal of a frozen decision, unrelated drive-by payload): do not merge.
  Comment with the evidence in the pull request's language. Do not silently
  reimplement the same idea as if the pull request never existed.
- Do not merge a draft pull request the author has not marked ready, unless
  the user explicitly asks to merge the draft. Comment with the principle
  review and wait until it is ready.
- A pull request link authorizes reviewing, commenting on, and merging
  **that** pull request when this rule applies. It does not authorize
  force-pushing the contributor's branch or publishing unrelated branches.
  Follow-up still follows R4's opt-in remote publishing rule.
- Do not comment on or merge unrelated pull requests. An already-merged pull
  request is not reopened; remaining gaps become ordinary follow-up.
- When both an issue and a pull request are linked, R6 applies to the pull
  request and R5 still applies to the issue after the merged outcome.

### R7 — Code-bearing changes require relevant E2E after main integration

> **Every code-bearing change must pass relevant E2E on the integrated local
> `main` before its request branch is pushed, a PR/MR is opened, or a
> commit-only delivery is declared complete.**

This rule applies to changes that modify executable or runtime-affecting
content, including `apps/`, `packages/`, `crates/`, runtime scripts, build or
CI configuration, packaging behavior, protocol behavior, and persisted data.
Documentation-only changes are exempt when they do not alter executable
behavior.

E2E execution is mandatory for code-bearing changes, and the gate runs on the
integrated local `main` commit that carries the change, before the branch push
and the PR/MR; a route that stops at local `main` runs it before the change is
declared delivered. Run the selected suites from the latest integrated local
`main` checkout and commit. An E2E run on the request branch itself is
exploratory and does not satisfy R7. Select suites using the
regression-surface guidance in `04-e2e-test-plan.md`; build, typecheck,
lint, unit tests, integration tests, manual review, and source inspection do
not replace relevant E2E.

Required validation is part of the authorized integration workflow and does
not require a separate user request to run tests.

If a required suite cannot run in the current environment, record the suite,
reason, alternative validation, and remaining risk as `NOT RUN`. The branch
push and PR/MR may still proceed with that record so the change can be
validated in a capable environment, but the gate is not satisfied and delivery
remains incomplete until the suite passes against the integrated `main` that
carries the change. A failed required suite blocks the push, the PR/MR, and
declaring the change delivered until the failure is classified and fixed.

After the PR/MR merges into remote `main`, rerun the affected suites when the
landed executable content differs from the commit the gate ran on (landing
fixes, conflict resolution, or commits added during review). Otherwise the
recorded result stands. Always state the commit the recorded E2E evidence
applies to.

### GitHub issue templates

`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` is the only public intake path (`blank_issues_enabled:
false`). English is the source label language; Chinese remains on the same
fields.

- **Bug report** requires: description, reproduction steps, expected behavior,
  actual behavior, app version, and OS. Logs, extra environment, and
  screenshots are optional. Settings → Info prefills version, OS, and
  environment when opened from the app (D313).
- **Feature request** requires: problem and proposed change. Alternatives and
  extra context are optional.

Do not weaken these required fields. Blank issues stay disabled.

## 2. Development Loop

Every change follows this sequence. Steps may be iterated if the implementation reveals new requirements. If the prompt includes a GitHub issue, complete R5 verification before step 1. If the prompt includes a GitHub pull request, complete the R6 principle review (and merge when sound) before starting a replacement or follow-up implementation.

```
0. If a GitHub issue is linked: verify the claim (R5) before any implementation
0b. If a GitHub pull request is linked: review the principle (R6); merge first when sound; start follow-up only after it is in `main`
1. Sync main + create a request branch and worktree
2. Read baseline + relevant specs
3. Plan change + list impacted specs and necessary validation
4. Implement
5. Update specs / ADR / decisions-log if needed
6. Update or add e2e scenarios when R3 applies
7. Run targeted local checks necessary for the change's risk
8. Commit with conventional message
9. Update BOARD if milestone-related
10. Complete the requested local `main` integration and run the relevant E2E
    gate from that integrated commit (R7); when remote delivery is authorized,
    push branch + open PR/MR to main only after that gate
11. Merge the PR/MR into remote `main` through the remote gates when remote
    delivery is authorized, synchronize local `main`, verify, and clean up
12. If launch was requested: build and start from integrated main
```

### Step-by-step

| Step | Action | Output |
|---|---|---|
| **0. Issue verify** | When a GitHub issue is linked, fetch it and independently verify that the reported problem exists. Stop here (comment, and close only if conclusive) when it does not. | Verified issue, or a comment and close/leave-open decision. |
| **0b. PR review** | When a GitHub pull request is linked, fetch it and independently judge whether the principle is sound. Merge first when it is; start follow-up only after it is in `main`. Stop (comment, do not rewrite) when it is not. | Merged contributor PR plus follow-up plan, or a comment and no merge. |
| **1. Branch + worktree** | Preserve existing work, update from `origin/main`, and create a dedicated request branch in a dedicated worktree. Reuse the primary checkout's environment where safe. | Isolated task files on current `main` with a consistent development environment. |
| **2. Read** | Read `00-baseline.md` and any specs relevant to the change area. | Mental model of constraints. |
| **3. Plan** | Describe the intended change. List every spec, ADR, and e2e scenario that will need updates, and assess whether local validation is necessary. | Change plan + impact and validation list. |
| **4. Implement** | Write code, config, or assets. | Changed files. |
| **5. Spec-sync** | Update specs per the impact list. Add ADR if architectural. Update `decisions-log.md` if an implementation default changes. | Updated docs/spec/\* and/or docs/adr/\*. |
| **6. E2E doc** | When R3 applies, add or update scenario entries in `04-e2e-test-plan.md` and link to acceptance criteria IDs (A–H). Otherwise, confirm no scenario update is needed. | Updated e2e test plan, or confirmed not applicable. |
| **7. Validate** | Use change risk and regression scope to select the smallest useful local checks. The relevant E2E gate for a code-bearing change runs on the integrated local `main` after step 10's local integration and before any branch push or PR/MR; a suite that cannot run is recorded as `NOT RUN` and keeps delivery incomplete. | Targeted check and E2E results, or an explicit environment limitation. |
| **8. Commit** | Git commit with conventional message (see §4). | One or more commits. |
| **9. BOARD** | If the change completes a milestone deliverable, update `docs/project/BOARD.md`. | Updated board. |
| **10. Local integrate + gate** | Complete the requested local `main` integration, then run the relevant E2E gate from that integrated commit. When remote publishing is authorized, push the request branch and open a PR/MR targeting `main` only after that gate. | Verified local `main` integration with the E2E gate result, or a recorded `NOT RUN` limitation; reviewable remote change or a local-only delivery route. |
| **11. Remote merge + cleanup** | For authorized remote delivery, merge the PR/MR into remote `main` through the required gates and synchronize local `main`; rerun the affected suites when the landed executable content differs from the commit the gate ran on. Verify the expected commits and remove the merged worktree and branch. | Requested integration complete, or an explicit blocker / narrower user-requested handoff. |
| **12. Launch** | When requested, build and start from the integrated `main` checkout and its development environment. | Running app includes the delivered change. |

### Local Validation and E2E Execution Policy

- Local validation is risk-based rather than an automatic prerequisite for
  delivery. Documentation-only changes and low-risk mechanical edits normally
  require no local tests or checks and proceed to the authorized delivery route
  under R4. No separate approval or waiver is needed to skip unnecessary checks;
  the required E2E gate on the integrated local `main` still applies to
  code-bearing changes.
- Changes with material regression risk, including security boundaries,
  protocol contracts, data migrations, build configuration, or widely shared
  behavior, normally require the smallest targeted non-E2E validation that can
  address that risk. A full local suite is not the default.
- E2E scenario documentation and E2E execution are separate concerns. R3 still
  requires scenario updates for user-visible or protocol-visible behavior.
- Every code-bearing change must run at least one relevant E2E suite on the
  integrated local `main` before its branch is pushed or a PR/MR is opened,
  and must run the union of suites required by the affected regression
  surfaces. The available commands are defined by the root `package.json` and
  the selection matrix in `04-e2e-test-plan.md`.
- Development-time iteration remains risk-based: an E2E run on the request
  branch may be used for debugging, but only a run against the integrated local
  `main` commit satisfies this policy.
- If the environment cannot run a required suite, record the suite, reason,
  alternative validation, and remaining risk as `NOT RUN`. The branch push and
  PR/MR may proceed with that record, but the gate is not satisfied and
  delivery remains incomplete until the suite passes against the integrated
  `main` that carries the change.
- Required E2E jobs that the hosting platform starts before a remote merge do
  not replace the local `main` gate. Observe and report their result; after
  the remote merge, rerun the affected suites when the landed executable
  content differs from the commit the gate ran on. Otherwise the recorded
  result stands.

### Marketplace/update diagnosis gate

Plugin update incidents require an evidence-first prompt flow before code
changes:

1. Capture the exact plugin ID, installed version, displayed version, expected
   release, catalog URL, and observation time.
2. Fetch the live catalog and inspect the exact entry, then inspect the local
   catalog cache and installed registry independently.
3. Classify the failure boundary: publisher/catalog data, fetch/cache fallback,
   host version comparison, IPC propagation, or renderer presentation.
4. Run `pnpm check:marketplace -- --url <catalog-url> --plugin <id>`. Missing
   `shasum`, `url`, positive `sizeBytes`, or `permissions`, or a catalog
   `author` that is not a string (for example `{ name, url }` copied from a
   plugin manifest), is a release-data failure, not evidence of a stale
   renderer. Incomplete releases remain non-installable.
5. Reproduce with a fixture containing unsorted versions and incomplete
   metadata before changing host or renderer code.

The agent must state which boundary failed and what evidence rules out the
other boundaries. A client-side fallback may preserve safe discovery, but it
must not be used to conceal an invalid marketplace release.

## 3. Spec Update Matrix

Which change types require which doc updates.

| Change type | Spec update | ADR | Decisions-log | E2E doc | BOARD |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| New feature (user-visible) | Related domain spec | If architectural boundary | — | New scenario | If milestone deliverable |
| Bug fix (user-visible) | Related spec if behavior clarified | — | — | New or updated scenario | — |
| Bug fix (internal) | — | — | — | — | — |
| Refactor (behavior preserved) | — | — | — | — | — |
| Architectural change | Related specs + baseline | **New ADR** | Update entry if default changes | Update affected scenarios | — |
| New IPC/RPC method | `03-runtime/01-ipc-protocol.md` or `06-host-rpc-protocol.md` | If contract boundary | — | New protocol scenario | — |
| Plugin API addition | `07-plugins/03-plugin-api.md` | If boundary change | — | New plugin scenario | If M4 deliverable |
| Security change | `05-security/01-security.md` | If boundary change | Update if D001–D010 touched | New security scenario | — |
| UX change | Related `04-ux/` spec | — | — | New UI scenario | — |
| Spec-only update | The spec itself | — | — | — | — |
| Chore (deps, tooling) | — | — | If tooling decision | — | — |
| **App version release / stable tag** | `06-delivery/06-release-runbook.md` (mandatory version-surface gate before tag: shipped-locale `packages/shared/src/changelog.ts`, its test list, all workspace/Cargo/`APP_VERSION` versions, and the release line in `README.md` + `README.zh-CN.md`) | — | If release policy changes | Confirm E2E-067B still accurate | If milestone ship |

## 4. Git Commit Rules

### 4.1 Conventional Commits

Format: `type(scope): description`

| Type | Use for |
|---|---|
| `feat` | New feature |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation-only change |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests |
| `chore` | Build, deps, tooling, CI |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring, no behavior change |
| `perf` | Performance improvement |
| `build` | Build system or external dependency change |
| `ci` | CI/CD configuration change |

**Scope** is optional but encouraged — e.g. `feat(host-core):`, `fix(ui):`, `docs(spec):`.

### 4.2 Language

- Commit messages: **English only** (matches baseline language policy).
- Body: optional; use for non-obvious context.

### 4.3 One logical change per commit

- Prefer small, focused commits.
- Spec updates that are tightly coupled to the code change should be in the same commit.
- Pure doc changes (spec rewrite, ADR) may be a separate adjacent `docs:` commit.

### 4.4 Never commit

- Secrets, API keys, tokens, passwords
- Local-only data (user configs, session data, logs)
- `node_modules/`, build artifacts, release packages
- Generated files that should be rebuilt per CI

### 4.5 Pre-commit checklist

Before committing, verify:

1. Change is one logical unit (or clearly split).
2. No secrets or local data in the diff.
3. Specs updated per §3 matrix.
4. E2E doc updated if behavior changed.
5. `git diff --stat` review — nothing unexpected.
6. Commit message follows conventional format.

---

## 5. Branching Model

The repository uses a mandatory request-branch and worktree workflow:

- **`main`** is always deployable and is the protected integration target. Do
  not develop or create development commits on it, or push it directly.
- **Request branches and worktrees** are mandatory for every development request,
  including docs, chores, and small fixes. Create each branch and worktree from
  an up-to-date `main`, then remove both immediately after the branch is merged
  into `main`.
- **Branch names** use `<type>/<short-description>` with a lowercase,
  kebab-case description. Allowed type prefixes mirror §4.1.
- **No long-lived development branch** exists. Each request gets a new branch;
  an old request branch must not be reused for unrelated work.
- **The primary checkout owns the default development environment.** Request
  worktrees reuse its toolchains, package-manager stores, caches, and ignored
  local configuration where safe. A request may create isolated local state
  when sharing would be unsafe or incompatible, but that state stays ignored
  and must not leak into commits.
- **Delivery follows R4's authorization boundary and its fixed order.**
  Commit-only delivery completes a validated local `main` merge. Authorized
  push/remote delivery first merges the request branch into local `main` and
  runs the required E2E gate against that integrated commit (R7), then pushes
  the request branch and opens the PR/MR, merges it into remote `main` through
  the PR/MR gates, and synchronizes local `main`. Explicit branch-only or
  draft-only requests retain their narrower scope.

Typical request start (run from the primary checkout; choose a path outside it):

```bash
git status --short
git fetch origin main
git worktree add -b <type>/<short-description> <worktree-path> origin/main
```

If `main` is checked out in a clean primary worktree, `git switch main` plus
`git fetch origin main` and `git pull --ff-only origin main` should be run
before `git worktree add`. That fast-forward fails once local `main` carries
its own integration merge of a delivered request; synchronize with
`git merge origin/main` in that case, and resolve the divergence before
starting new work without discarding commits. If the primary worktree is not
clean or is on another branch, leave it untouched and create the request
worktree directly from the fetched `origin/main`. Never discard, stash, move,
or overwrite unrelated work merely to satisfy this sequence.

Environment reuse is resource-specific. Package-manager stores and language
toolchains are normally shared automatically. Ignored local configuration or a
compatible dependency tree may be referenced or linked from the primary
checkout when a task needs it. Build outputs that can race, mutable runtime
data, and incompatible dependency trees must remain worktree-local.

Typical authorized GitHub delivery (use the hosting platform's equivalent when
needed; synchronize and clean up from the clean primary checkout after merge):

```bash
# from the primary checkout: local `main` integration and the R7 E2E gate come first
cd <primary-checkout>
git fetch origin main
git switch main
git merge <type>/<short-description>
# run the required E2E suites for this change from the integrated local `main` (R7)
git push -u origin <type>/<short-description>
gh pr create --base main --head <type>/<short-description>
gh pr checks --watch
gh pr merge --merge
git fetch origin main
git merge origin/main
git merge-base --is-ancestor <type>/<short-description> origin/main
git worktree remove <worktree-path>
git branch -d <type>/<short-description>
git worktree prune
git push origin --delete <type>/<short-description>
```

After the remote merge, synchronize local `main` with `git merge origin/main`:
local `main` normally carries its own integration merge of the request branch
and is no longer strictly behind `origin/main`. Reset local `main` to
`origin/main` once the request commits are verified present in remote `main`
and that local merge is no longer needed; the reset also restores plain
fast-forward synchronization for later requests.

If the primary checkout cannot take the local integration merge, use a
short-lived worktree for `main` instead of disturbing unrelated work. If the
PR/MR is abandoned, the local integration merge remains in local `main` until
it is reset.

Request cleanup when the request is integrated by merging into local `main`
instead of a remote PR/MR (run from the primary checkout):

```bash
git switch main
git merge <type>/<short-description>
git merge-base --is-ancestor <type>/<short-description> main
git worktree remove <worktree-path>
git branch -d <type>/<short-description>
git worktree prune
```

For local-only delivery, `git branch -d` may refuse because the request branch
still tracks `origin/main`, which does not contain the locally delivered
commits. Only if the ancestry check above exited successfully and this is your
own request branch with that inherited upstream, unset its upstream and retry
normal deletion:

```bash
git branch --unset-upstream <type>/<short-description>
git branch -d <type>/<short-description>
```

Local `main` must contain every task commit. This fallback does not apply to
a published request branch whose remote `main` integration is still pending.

The worktree must be clean before removal; commit or discard the request's own
leftover changes first. Use `git branch -d` rather than `-D` so an unmerged
branch refuses to delete. If `git worktree remove` reports the worktree as dirty
or locked, resolve that state instead of forcing removal, and never remove
another request's worktree.

---

## 6. Definition of Done

A change is **Done** when all applicable conditions are true, respecting an
explicit branch-only or draft-only delivery scope:

1. A dedicated request branch and worktree were created from an up-to-date
   `main`.
2. Code (or doc) implements the planned change.
3. All impacted specs are updated.
4. E2E scenarios are documented (or confirmed not needed per §3).
5. Necessary targeted local validation passes; for a code-bearing change the
   relevant E2E gate has run against the integrated local `main` commit before
   the branch push, the PR/MR, or a commit-only completion, or the environment
   limitation is recorded as `NOT RUN` and delivery remains incomplete until
   the suite passes against the integrated `main` that carries the change;
   automatically triggered remote gates also pass.
6. Change is committed with a conventional message.
7. BOARD is updated if a milestone deliverable completed.
8. No secrets or local data are present in the commit.
9. Requested commit/push delivery is integrated into local `main` before the
   request branch is pushed or the PR/MR is opened. When remote delivery was
   authorized, the PR/MR was reviewed and merged into remote `main`, local
   `main` includes the landed change, and the affected suites were rerun when
   the landed executable content differs from the commit the gate ran on.
10. After integration, the expected commits were verified in `main`, the request
    worktree was removed, and the merged request branch was deleted.
11. If a GitHub issue was linked: the claim was verified before implementation;
    the issue received a comment in its language; and the issue was closed when
    the outcome was conclusive.
12. If a GitHub pull request was linked: the principle was reviewed; the pull
    request was merged first when sound; follow-up landed after merge; the
    contributor's work was not discarded.
13. If launch was requested after delivery: the app was built and started from
    the integrated `main` checkout and its development environment.

### Release / version-tag gate

When the change is a **stable app version release** (version bump + tag),
Definition of Done also requires, **before** the tag, that every
version-bearing surface describes the new version: the shipped-locale in-app
changelog entries in `packages/shared/src/changelog.ts` (English and every
shipped product locale, with aligned highlight counts) with its `changelog.test.ts` list, every workspace
`package.json` (including `docs/package.json`), the Cargo workspace version and
`host-core` lockfile entry, `APP_VERSION`, and the release line stated in
`README.md` + `README.zh-CN.md`. `node scripts/check-release-docs.mjs` must
pass; `scripts/release.mjs` runs it and refuses to tag otherwise. See
[06-release-runbook.md §4.1](06-release-runbook.md#41-mandatory-release-version-surface-gate-d164--d260),
D164, and D260. GitHub release notes are not a substitute.

## 7. Forbidden Practices

| Practice | Why |
|---|---|
| Committing secrets | Security violation |
| Large uncommitted diffs | Violates R2; loss of granularity |
| Changing behavior without spec update | Violates R1; specs become unreliable |
| Skipping e2e doc for user-visible changes | Violates R3; traceability gap |
| Declaring a code-bearing change complete without successful relevant E2E after integration into local or remote `main` | Violates R7 and leaves cross-process behavior unverified |
| Treating the full local test/check suite as an automatic pre-push requirement | Ignores risk-based validation and delays delivery without evidence of need |
| Developing or creating development commits on `main`, or pushing it directly | Violates R4; bypasses isolation and review gates |
| Developing a new request in the primary checkout or another request's worktree | Violates R4; mixes task files and local state |
| Reusing a request branch for unrelated work | Mixes request scope and weakens traceability |
| Stopping at a task-branch commit or push when the user requested commit/push delivery | Violates R4 unless the user explicitly limited delivery to a branch or draft |
| Leaving a merged request worktree on disk | Violates R4; stale worktrees accumulate and invite cross-request contamination |
| Modifying baseline frozen decisions without ADR + version bump | Baseline is frozen; changes need formal process |
| Committing generated artifacts that CI should rebuild | Repo bloat, merge conflicts |
| Mixing multiple logical changes in one commit without clear message | Loss of history granularity |
| Implementing a linked GitHub issue without verifying the problem exists | Violates R5; wastes work on invalid or already-fixed claims |
| Closing a linked GitHub issue without a comment in the issue language | Violates R5; leaves no public record of the outcome |
| Closing, rewriting, or requesting a restart of a linked pull request whose principle is sound | Violates R6; discards the contributor's work |
| Blocking merge of a sound linked pull request solely for missing specs, tests, style, or agent-workflow completeness | Violates R6; completeness is follow-up after merge |
| Merging a linked pull request whose principle is unsound or that introduces a harm blocker | Violates R6; merge-first does not apply to unsafe or wrong-direction changes |
| Force-pushing a contributor's branch to land a linked pull request | Violates R6; landing fixes go on top of the author's commits |
| Tagging a stable app release without updating `packages/shared/src/changelog.ts` for every shipped locale | Violates D164 / D345 / release runbook; in-app What's new is empty for that locale and version |
| Tagging a stable app release while `README.md` / `README.zh-CN.md` still state an older release line, or bypassing `scripts/check-release-docs.mjs` with `--skip-docs-check` | Violates D260 / release runbook; published documentation advertises a version the release no longer matches |
| Pushing a request branch or opening a PR/MR before the required E2E has run against the integrated local `main`, or declaring a code-bearing change delivered without that result (except a recorded `NOT RUN` limitation) | Violates R7's fixed order; review would start on an unvalidated commit |

## 8. Acceptance Criteria for This Workflow

This workflow spec itself is accepted when:

- [ ] R1/R2/R3/R4/R5/R6/R7 are stated clearly and cross-linked to relevant specs.
- [ ] Development loop is documented and referenced by `AGENTS.md`.
- [ ] Spec update matrix covers all change types in the baseline.
- [ ] Git commit rules match existing repo commit style (`docs:`, `chore:`).
- [ ] Every development request is required to use a dedicated branch and
      worktree created from current `main`.
- [ ] Request worktrees reuse the primary checkout's environment where safe
      without committing local environment state.
- [ ] Commit/push requests complete local `main` integration without another
      merge confirmation; explicit branch-only or draft-only limits prevail.
- [ ] Remote publishing requires authorization and uses PR/MR gates before
      remote `main` integration and local synchronization.
- [ ] Local `main` integration and the relevant E2E gate precede the request
      branch push and the pull request.
- [ ] Worktree removal and branch deletion are required immediately after the
      request branch is merged into `main`, including local-merge delivery.
- [ ] Relevant E2E execution is mandatory for code-bearing changes on the
      integrated local `main` before the PR/MR is opened, without a separate
      test request; E2E documentation remains mandatory under R3.
- [ ] Local validation is risk-based; unnecessary checks may be skipped without
      blocking commit, push, or PR/MR creation.
- [ ] Definition of Done is complete and actionable.
- [ ] Forbidden practices list covers known risk areas.
- [ ] `AGENTS.md` points to this doc, `04-e2e-test-plan.md`, and `05-change-checklist.md`.
- [ ] Linked GitHub issues are verified before implementation, then commented
      on in the issue language and closed when conclusive.
- [ ] Linked GitHub pull requests whose principle is sound are merged first,
      then followed up; contributor work is not discarded.
- [ ] All indexes updated (NAV, delivery README, spec README, docs README, BOARD).
