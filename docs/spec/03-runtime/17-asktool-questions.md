# 17. asktool Interactive Questions

## 1. Purpose

`asktool` lets the model pause a turn and ask the user one or more bounded
questions. It is available in Agent, Plan, and Goal mode and is separate from
permission approval: it does not authorize an operation and has no validity
deadline.

## 2. Request shape

The tool accepts a non-empty `questions` array. Each question contains:

- `question`: the prompt text, which may include Markdown;
- `options`: one or more selectable answer labels, each either a Markdown
  string or an object with a required Markdown `label` and optional plain-text
  `description`;
- `multiSelect`: optional; when true, more than one selectable answer is allowed.

Plain string options remain supported. The card renders CommonMark/GFM text
formatting such as emphasis, inline code, paragraphs, and lists. Links render as
non-interactive text, images as alt text, and raw HTML is ignored. Question
text and option labels use the same renderer; optional descriptions remain plain
text. Rendering never rewrites the option value: selection and the model-facing
answer use its normalized source label. The desktop card always adds one extra `Enter another answer`
option with a text field. The model does not need to add a special free-text
choice to the tool arguments.

## 3. Card interaction

Only one question is shown at a time. A small indicator is rendered for every
question and uses three states: unanswered, answered, and skipped. Selecting an
indicator revisits that question. `Next` records an answer when one exists;
otherwise it records a skip. `Skip` explicitly records a skip and advances.
`Decline all` resolves every question as skipped.

There is no timer, countdown, or automatic expiration. The card remains pending
until the user submits or the turn is stopped. If the turn is stopped while a
card is open, the runtime resolves every remaining question as skipped.

When an ask arrives, the app shows an in-app toast with a stable localized
prompt title and the first question; background sessions also follow the
existing native notification policy. Ask titles deliberately do not interpolate
the session title, because generated titles may contain tool-call text. The ask
event plays one soft in-app chime; its toast does not play a second one.

## 4. Tool output

The response is the normal tool result returned to the model and persisted with
the tool row. Markdown source is retained in the serialized question and
selected label; rendering is presentation-only. For each question, content is
serialized as:

```text
question text：answer label 1、answer label 2
```

Multiple questions are separated by `\n---\n`. A skipped or unanswered
question keeps the question text and uses an empty placeholder:

```text
question text：
```

This format is deterministic, preserves question order, and makes multi-select
answers distinguishable without exposing a renderer-only state object to the
model.

## 5. Transcript summary

The completed asktool row in conversation history presents persisted
`details.questions` and `details.answers` as an ordered question-and-answer
summary. Multi-select answers remain separate labels, and skipped questions
have an explicit localized state. This is a read-only projection: the
model-facing text and stored tool result are unchanged. If structured details
are unavailable or invalid, the transcript keeps its generic result rendering
so imported or malformed history remains inspectable.
