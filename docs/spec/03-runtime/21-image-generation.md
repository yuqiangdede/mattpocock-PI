# Image generation and editing

The desktop exposes `AppSettings.imageGeneration` as the current default image-generation binding and `AppSettings.imageGenerationModels` as the optional list of models marked for image generation. The legacy single binding remains supported: when the list is absent, it is treated as the only candidate. A null or empty current binding means no default; host-core validates and persists both fields through the existing settings store. No schema bump is needed. Each candidate is independent of the conversation default and references an existing enabled API-key or no-auth provider and one of its configured models.

## Configuration

Model Advanced exposes **Set as image model** alongside the image and document attachment capabilities in the model capability group, not as a separate control row. The checkbox is multi-select: saving a provider persists every checked model in `imageGenerationModels`; Cancel leaves settings unchanged. Saving candidates does not replace the default conversation model. Unchecking the current image model and saving removes its default binding: the first remaining runnable candidate becomes the default, or the default becomes null if none remains. The unmarked model is available for chat again after saving and reopening settings. Saving another provider preserves a still-runnable image default. Below the default model row in the same defaults panel, **Image generation model** shows the current default and offers a menu to choose one from all marked candidates. When no candidate is configured, the summary row is hidden. An existing candidate that is missing, disabled, credential-less or removed displays only **Currently unavailable**. OAuth accounts are not eligible; there is no fallback.
All marked provider/model pairs are excluded from the default conversation picker, provider quick-default action, and Composer model menu. Other providers with the same model ID remain independent. Existing conversation bindings and history are preserved; a conversation still pinned to any image candidate must select a chat model before sending. Runtime launch rejects every marked image model before inference.

## Agent contract

`GenerateImages({items: [{prompt, count?, images?}]})` is an Agent-mode tool.
`count` defaults to 1. Both distinct prompts and same-prompt variants are supported,
with 1–10 output images total. An optional `images` array supplies 1–4 local source
files per item for editing; a previous generated path supports iterative edits.
Prompt length is bounded at 32,000 characters. Unsupported or excessive input is
rejected rather than truncated. Plan and Goal cannot execute the tool.

The bundled `pi-desktop/imagegen` skill is discoverable in ordinary sessions and
loads through the existing Skill tool. It teaches prompting, batches, reference
edits, preserving originals, partial-failure handling and project asset delivery.
It does not grant permission or carry credentials.

The trusted desktop bridge first calls host-core `tools.execute` with the same
identity, arguments and permission scope. Host-core applies the existing high-risk
tool policy and returns authorization only. The bridge executes the image service
only after approval. The host authorization audit is distinct from the actual
sidecar tool result. Runtime cancellation reaches both pending approval and the
network request; host loss or sidecar disposal aborts local work.

## OpenAI Images adapter

Only OpenAI-compatible Images is supported. A root base URL acquires `/v1`; an
explicit path prefix is retained. Generation uses `POST images/generations` with
`model`, `prompt`, `n: 1`. Editing uses `POST images/edits`, multipart image files,
the prompt, model and `n: 1`. No browser mask editor is included. A configured
service may implement generation without editing; its error is reported without
silently switching to generation or another model.
For exact DALL-E 2/3 model IDs, generation requests explicitly ask for
`response_format: b64_json`; the same form field is used for DALL-E edits where
supported. GPT Image and unknown compatible model IDs omit that parameter.
Editing retains binary multipart uploads (`image` for one reference, `image[]`
for multiple), with the transport generating the Content-Type boundary.

Each batch snapshots the binding and provider before dispatch, uses two workers,
and returns results in input order. Each output has a 180-second request budget.
Requests are never automatically retried. Authentication failure stops queued
work. Cancellation stops queued work and aborts active HTTP; it cannot promise the
upstream provider stopped processing or billing. Completed output files survive.

Responses accept exactly one Base64 image or HTTPS image URL per request. JSON and
download bodies are bounded; image files are capped at 16 MiB and restricted to
PNG, JPEG and WebP signatures. Downloads use checked, pinned public DNS addresses,
reject redirects and private destinations, and never receive provider headers.
Input edits accept the session project, that session's scratch directory and the
attachment store after realpath containment. Each edit input set is capped at
32 MiB, with a 64 MiB input cache budget for the batch. Credentials remain outside the renderer and tool results.

## Results and recovery

Saving a provider confirms the provider was saved or updated, including when
image capabilities were marked or unmarked. It must not claim that an image
model was selected after deselection. Choosing an image default from the
summary menu retains the image-selection confirmation.

Each result records index, status (`succeeded`, `failed`, `cancelled`), successful
path/MIME type or a safe error code. New files get unique names in session scratch;
editing never overwrites its source. The tool result and transcript retain file
references, not Base64. Existing bounded image reads and file viewers serve previews.
Thrown local-tool errors preserve stable `errorCode` values across the real
sidecar RPC boundary, independently of ordinary structured tool-result failures.
Existing RPC code, message and data are retained; arbitrary Error properties
are not serialized. The sidecar receiver exposes the code alongside its data.
Successful images and per-item failures render even when only part of a batch
completed. Missing configuration returns a structured error and a Settings → Models
navigation action. The same references render after session reload/restart.
Image results and setup actions remain visible outside the turn's collapsible
process details; opening tool details does not duplicate the image gallery.
Markdown image references to generated absolute paths, including Windows drive
paths, use the existing bounded host image reader. URL sanitization stays enabled;
the host still rejects files outside its permitted workspace/scratch/attachment roots.

Validation: `node scripts/e2e-image-generation.mjs` covers host/stdio/HTTP/storage;
`node scripts/e2e-image-generation-ui.mjs` covers real React/Chromium interactions
with an API-boundary fixture. Unit/service tests cover limits, cancellation,
partial failures, authentication, timeout, unsafe paths, and bounded downloads.
`node scripts/e2e-image-chat.mjs` exercises the full isolated desktop with local
model/image HTTP fixtures: adjacent default settings, composer submission, batch
previews, editing a generated file, collapsed results, and setup navigation.
Live verification is opt-in via `scripts/test-image-generation-live.mjs`, limited
to one generation plus one edit and never a default test command.
