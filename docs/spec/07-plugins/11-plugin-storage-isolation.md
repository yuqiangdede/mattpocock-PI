# 11. Plugin Storage Isolation

## 1. Goals

Isolate plugin data from the host's core data to avoid cross-contamination and unauthorized reads.

## 2. Directory layout

```text
~/.pi-desktop/
 ├── pi.sqlite # host DB (03-runtime/04); plugins never open it
 ├── plugins/
 │ ├── installed/<plugin-id>/
 │ ├── disabled/ # optional
 │ ├── data/<plugin-id>/
 │ ├── logs/<plugin-id>.log
 │ ├── cache/download/
 │ └── registry.json
 └── ...
```

Bundled marketplace fallback packages use the owning plugin manager's data
root (`plugins/market/packages`), just like its catalog and download cache.
Catalog construction never re-reads the process-wide `PI_DESKTOP_DATA_DIR`;
independent host instances must not share package paths through that mutable
default. Package size and checksum validation remain mandatory.

## 3. registry.json (logical model)

```ts
type PluginRegistry = {
 schemaVersion: 1
 plugins: Array<{
 id: string
 version: string
 enabled: boolean
 source: "installed" | "dev" | "marketplace"
 path: string
 installedAt: string
 updatedAt: string
 permissionsGranted: string[]
 marketplace?: {
 providerId: string
 shasum?: string
 publisherId?: string
 }
 }>
}
```

## 4. Plugin private data

`pi.plugin.getDataPath()` points to:

```text
~/.pi-desktop/plugins/data/<plugin-id>/
```

Uses:
- cache
- local index
- large plugin config files

Prohibited:
- Using this API to obtain another pluginId's path

## 5. Settings storage

Plugin settings can be stored in:

- The host DB's `kv` table under the plugin's namespace (03-runtime/04 §4.1)
- Or settings.json under the plugin data directory

Storing centrally in the host is recommended for easier backup and uninstall cleanup.

```ts
// kv: ns = `plugin:<plugin-id>`, key, value_json, updated_at
// uninstall cleanup = DELETE FROM kv WHERE ns = 'plugin:<plugin-id>'
```

## 6. Log isolation

Each plugin has its own log channel:
- File: `plugins/logs/<plugin-id>.log`
- UI: filterable by plugin

Host core logs are not written into plugin files.

## 7. Session and secret isolation

Plugins cannot directly access:
- pi.sqlite (sessions, settings, any host table)
- secrets
- provider key
- other plugins' private registry data

The reviewed `desktop.control` gateway now offers the bounded session
collaboration projection and mutation catalog. It does not expose host tables,
transcript files, credentials, Electron IPC, or the MCP bearer token. The host
derives source identity from the active Agent tool invocation, persists the
delivery and provenance ledger in host-core, and audits the plugin operation;
plugin-private state is never treated as authorization or session identity.

## 8. Uninstall cleanup policy

Default:
- Delete installed code
- Delete data
- Delete logs (or keep the most recent one)

Advanced:
- Keep data

## 9. Backup suggestions

A future export/backup can be split into:
- Host config only
- Host config + plugin list
- Full (including plugin data)

The MVP does not implement a full backup protocol; it only reserves directory boundaries.

## 10. Acceptance

1. A plugin can only write to its own data directory
2. Data is cleaned up per policy after uninstall
3. The registry can restore the installed list
4. Plugin logs can be viewed separately
