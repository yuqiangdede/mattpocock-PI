# ADR 0074: Native notification permission for plugins

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-08-12

## Context

The plugin `notify` capability currently exposes only an in-app Toast. PI-Desktop
already uses Electron's native notification API for terminal task outcomes, but
that surface is intentionally owned by the application and backed by the
durable task notification inbox. Plugins need a way to ask the operating system
for notification access and deliver a native notification without gaining
access to Electron objects or the task inbox.

Electron does not expose a cross-platform, read-only notification permission
query or a separate permission-request method for its main-process
`Notification` class. Native delivery reports success or failure through the
notification lifecycle, and operating-system policies may suppress a banner
without reporting a durable state.

## Decision

Keep `pi.ui.notify` as the backwards-compatible in-app Toast. Add three
permission-gated APIs under `pi.ui`:

- `getNotificationPermission()` returns `granted`, `denied`, `unknown`, or
  `unsupported`.
- `requestNotificationPermission()` performs a short native notification probe
  and returns the best-effort result.
- `showNativeNotification({ title, body? })` sends a native notification and
  returns `{ shown, permission }`.

All three APIs use the existing low-risk manifest `notify` permission. The
Electron main process owns the native objects, limits title/body lengths, and
keeps plugin notifications separate from the durable task inbox. Native plugin
notifications do not create inbox rows or session activation events on click.

The permission result is deliberately best-effort. Before a native result is
observed, or when the operating system does not report one, the API returns
`unknown`; unsupported platforms return `unsupported`. This avoids pretending
that Electron can reliably reflect a platform setting it cannot query.

## Consequences

- Plugins can provide OS-level reminders and status updates while remaining
  behind the existing plugin permission review.
- Existing plugins keep their Toast behavior and source compatibility.
- A plugin must handle `unknown`, `denied`, and `unsupported` without assuming
  that a native banner was delivered.
- The task notification inbox remains application-owned and cannot be used as a
  plugin persistence or navigation channel.

## Alternatives considered

- Replacing `pi.ui.notify` with native delivery: rejected because it silently
  changes existing plugin behavior and conflates Toasts with OS notifications.
- Adding a platform-specific permission package: rejected for this API revision;
  it would add platform-specific dependencies without a common Electron
  permission contract.
- Allowing plugins to construct Electron `Notification` objects: rejected by
  the plugin isolation boundary.
