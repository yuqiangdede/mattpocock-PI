- Updates: removes the standalone command palette surface described in
  [08-component-spec §16](../spec/04-ux/08-component-spec.md)

## Context

The app shipped two overlapping "find anything" surfaces:

- A **command palette** (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P) that lists built-in and plugin
  commands, opened from a dedicated top-bar button and a separate overlay.
- A **global search** (Cmd/Ctrl+K) that lists sessions, pages, and settings.

Both are searchable overlays with the same interaction model (type, arrow,
Enter, Esc). Keeping them separate meant two surfaces to maintain, a second
button in the top bar, and a split mental model for users: "commands live here,
everything else lives there." The top-bar command-palette button also competed
for space with the search button.

## Decision

1. Remove the standalone command palette overlay (`CommandPalette.tsx`) and its
   top-bar button.
2. Render the command list (built-in + plugin commands) as a **Commands**
   section inside the existing global search dialog (`SearchDialog.tsx`), using
   the same `role="listbox"` / `role="option"` semantics and flat option-index
   navigation as the other result groups.
3. The `openCommandPalette` shortcut (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P, per D014) now opens the
   global search dialog, which contains the Commands section. `Cmd/Ctrl+K`
   continues to open the same dialog. Both chords reach commands.
4. Remove the redundant "Command Palette" entry from the application View menu
   (the View menu already has "Search"). The shortcut id is retained so the
   keyboard-shortcuts settings page and plugin command discovery keep working.
5. The command data path is unchanged: `api.searchCommands` and
   `runPaletteCommand` (built-in + plugin bridge) are reused by the search
   dialog.

## Consequences

- One searchable surface covers sessions, pages, settings, and commands.
- The top bar loses a button; search is the single entry point for discovery.
- `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P` still works and now lands on the unified search with the
  command list available; muscle memory is preserved.
- `CommandPalette.tsx`, its CSS surface, and the `paletteOpen` state are removed.
- Plugin command discovery (E2E-023) and disable-removes-contributions
  (E2E-025) are re-expressed against the global search.

## Alternatives

### Keep two separate surfaces

Rejected: duplicates interaction logic and UI, adds a second top-bar button,
and forces users to decide which surface holds what. The merge simplifies both
code and UX.

### Hide commands behind a query in global search

Rejected: the command palette was reachable with an empty query (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P
showed all commands). The Commands section therefore renders even with an empty
query so the shortcut keeps its behavior.
