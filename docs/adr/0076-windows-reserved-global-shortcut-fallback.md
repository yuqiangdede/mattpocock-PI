# ADR 0076: Capture the Windows-reserved plugin launcher chord in host-core

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-08-12
- Deciders: PI-Desktop core

## Context

Windows reserves `Alt+Space` for the active window system menu. Electron's
`globalShortcut` may therefore reject the plugin launcher's default binding,
and a renderer `before-input-event` fallback only works while PI-Desktop is
focused.

## Decision

Host-core installs a narrow Windows `WH_KEYBOARD_LL` hook for the default
`Alt+Space` binding. It consumes the matching keydown, emits the existing
JSON-RPC notification transport with `keyboard.shortcut`, and lets Electron
toggle the plugin launcher. Electron sends the additive
`keyboard.setGlobalShortcut` host method whenever the effective binding
changes; the hook is enabled only when the effective Windows binding is
`Alt+Space`. Other platforms and custom bindings retain Electron's normal
global shortcut path.

The hook does not inspect or persist text, and it does not expose a new
renderer or plugin capability. If hook installation fails, the focused-window
fallback remains available and the failure is logged.

## Consequences

- The default Windows launcher chord works while another application is
  foregrounded and does not open that application's system menu.
- The host binary owns a small platform-specific input integration, while
  Electron remains responsible for window creation and plugin-panel access.
- Protocol version and storage schema remain unchanged because the method and
  notification are additive and Electron is the only consumer.
