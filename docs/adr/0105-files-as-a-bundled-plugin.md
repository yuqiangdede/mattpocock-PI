## Context

The work panel has a public extension point for plugin-contributed views. The
bundled Files browser should exercise that public path rather than remaining a
special host-only view. Review remains message-owned by ADR 0043 and therefore
has a different ownership boundary.

## Decision

1. `pi.files` is a first-party plugin shipped from
   `apps/desktop/resources/plugins/` and contributes its view through
   `contributes.views` just like a third-party plugin.
2. The bundled plugin is enabled by default, cannot be uninstalled, and can be
   disabled by the user. Its filesystem access uses the public permission-gated
   read APIs.
3. Only the Files *tool* migrates. Transcript-owned `file:<path>` resources and
   Review artifacts remain host-rendered and message/session scoped.
4. Browser remains the host-built work-panel tool because its embedded
   WebContentsView and navigation controls are host window machinery.
5. The former proposal to keep an interactive terminal in the host is
   superseded by ADR 0108. There is no plugin PTY API and no private bundled
   plugin channel.

## Consequences

- The shipped plugin is a real consumer of the public contributed-view and
  filesystem APIs; gaps in those APIs are caught by a first-party feature.
- The launcher lists Browser and active plugin views. Review and file resources
  are opened by conversation artifacts.
- The plugin trust boundary stays unchanged: no plugin permission can spawn an
  interactive shell.

## Alternatives considered

### Keep Files, Review, and the interactive terminal as host tools

Rejected for Files: it would leave the public plugin extension point untested.
Review remains host-owned because its evidence belongs to transcript messages.
The interactive terminal is removed rather than migrated; ADR 0108 records why.

### Give the bundled plugin private host capabilities

Rejected: a private channel would not test the public plugin API and would
recreate the host/plugin trust split this ADR is intended to reduce.
