# ADR 0113: Persist Provider Model Bindings and Thinking Configuration

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-08-21
- Deciders: PI-Desktop core
- Updates ADR 0020 and ADR 0027

## Context

The provider studio previously stored one `defaultModelId` and kept context,
output, and thinking capability decisions in runtime/catalog code. That made a
provider unable to retain settings for more than one model and made custom
models indistinguishable from an unconfigured default. The new provider dialog
needs to select several models, retain independent limits for each one, and
allow users to explicitly enable or disable thinking levels.

## Decision

`ProviderPublic`, `ProviderCreateInput`, and `ProviderUpdateInput` expose a
`models: ModelBinding[]` field. A binding contains:

```ts
type ModelBinding = {
  id: string
  contextWindow: number
  maxTokens: number
  thinkingLevels: ThinkingLevel[]
  defaultThinkingLevel: ThinkingLevel | null
}
```

Rust host-core persists the array under `providers.config_json.models`, which
keeps provider-specific settings additive and inside the existing storage
owner. `default_model_id` remains a compatibility field and mirrors the first
binding on new writes. Current conversations continue to resolve the first
binding; a future conversation model picker may select another binding.

The built-in pi-ai catalog remains authoritative for known-model metadata.
The settings UI uses its context window, max output, reasoning flag, and
thinking-level map as initial values, but writes user edits into the binding.
Unknown custom models use 128,000 context, 8,192 max output, no thinking
levels, and a null default. A model may be manually enabled for thinking after
it is created.

## Migration and compatibility

When a stored provider has no `config_json.models` array, host-core materializes
one binding from `default_model_id` with the custom fallback values. The
materialized binding is returned by `providers.list` / `providers.get`; the next
provider create/update writes the new array. Existing clients may continue to
send or read `defaultModelId`, and Electron main falls back through
`models[0]?.id` before the legacy field when resolving a runtime model.

## Consequences

- Multiple model configurations survive restart and provider edits.
- Thinking-level fallback is deterministic: the canonical order is
  `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`.
- Empty thinking support is represented by `thinkingLevels: []` and
  `defaultThinkingLevel: null`, rather than a fake `off` selection.
- The provider storage contract changes additively without a new SQLite table
  or migration version.
- Conversation model switching and routing policies remain explicitly out of
  scope; the first binding is the current runtime default.
