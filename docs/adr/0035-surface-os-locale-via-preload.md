- Updates: the `window.piDesktop` preload contract in
  [api.ts](../..//apps/desktop/src/lib/api.ts)

## Context

The Settings → Basics → Language control offers an **Auto** option that should
follow the user's OS display language. The original implementation resolved
"auto" from the renderer's `navigator.language`.

In Electron, the renderer's `navigator.language` is the embedded browser
locale and defaults to `en-US` regardless of the actual OS language. On a
Chinese system the renderer still reports `en-US`, so "Auto" resolved to
English even though the OS was Simplified Chinese. The same default also seeded
the initial i18n language on first paint.

The reliable source is the main process: `app.getLocale()` reads the OS display
language (macOS `AppleLanguages`, Windows user UI language, Linux `LANG`). The
main process already owns OS-level facts; the renderer only needed a way to read
them synchronously before first paint.

## Decision

1. Expose the authoritative OS locale from the preload bridge as a synchronous
   field `window.piDesktop.locale`, backed by `app.getLocale()` in the main
   process (alongside the existing `platform` field).
2. Add `locale: string` to the `window.piDesktop` type in `api.ts`.
3. Resolve "auto" language through a new `resolveOsLocale()` helper in
   `lib/app-language.ts` that prefers `window.piDesktop.locale` and falls back to
   `navigator.language` / `userLanguage` for non-Electron contexts (e.g. tests).
4. Seed the initial i18n `lng` in `main.tsx` from `resolveOsLocale()` instead of
   `navigator.language`.

This keeps OS-fact resolution in the main process and requires no new IPC
channel (the value is available before first paint, like `platform`).

## Consequences

- "Auto" language now matches the real OS display language (e.g. Simplified
  Chinese on a Chinese system), and the Auto card shows the detected language
  inline ("当前：简体中文").
- Initial i18n language on first paint is correct for the OS locale.
- The `window.piDesktop` preload contract grows one read-only string field.
- Non-Electron contexts (unit tests, potential web builds) fall back to
  `navigator.language` and remain functional.

## Alternatives

### Keep using `navigator.language`

Rejected: it is the root cause of the misdetection and cannot see the OS
language from the renderer in Electron.

### Add an async IPC call for the OS locale

Rejected: an async round-trip would delay first paint of the correct language
and complicate the synchronous pre-paint setup that already uses `platform`.
Surfacing the value synchronously from the bridge is simpler and sufficient.
