# ADR 0120: Bounded Session History Windows

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-08-24
- Deciders: PI-Desktop core
- Related: D119, ADR 0041, `03-runtime/04-data-storage.md`,
  `03-runtime/06-host-rpc-protocol.md`

## Context

Opening a session previously read its complete JSONL transcript, projected
every message, and sent the complete result through host-core, Electron, and
the renderer. A single large pasted or tool-produced value could therefore
make a 50 MB transcript allocation and block the desktop while a long session
was being opened. Mount-time virtualization did not solve the problem because
the full payload had already crossed the process boundary.

## Decision

1. Renderer-facing `session.get` supports an additive read window with
   `messageBefore`, `messageLimit`, and `contentLimit`. The host returns
   `messageStart` and `hasMoreBefore` so the renderer can page toward older
   messages while preserving the newest view.
2. Host-core reads JSONL with a buffered sequential parser and projects only
   the requested page. `contentLimit` truncates only the derived display
   projection, with an explicit marker; the lossless transcript on disk and
   the uncapped sidecar/model path remain authoritative.
3. The desktop opens sessions with the newest 100 messages and a 64 KiB
   per-message display budget. Scrolling near the top fetches older pages and
   preserves the viewport's scroll position. Deliberate full-history rewrites
   first rehydrate the complete transcript before replacing it, so a partial
   renderer window cannot delete older messages.
4. The uncapped default remains available to non-renderer callers, so model
   reconstruction and persistence semantics do not depend on UI pagination.

## Alternatives considered

- **Only virtualize the message list:** rejected because the expensive full
  parse and IPC payload would still happen before rendering.
- **Store only a preview in the transcript:** rejected because it loses user
  data and changes model context semantics.
- **Use a database payload table for paging:** rejected for now; the JSONL
  transcript remains the lossless source and a streaming window avoids a schema
  migration while fixing the boundary that caused the stall.

## Consequences

- Session activation has bounded renderer memory and IPC work independent of
  the total visible history, apart from the sequential scan needed to locate
  the requested page.
- Older history is available on demand, and display-only truncation is clear
  to the user while the complete content remains available to the agent.
- Full-history edit, delete, revision-switch, and abort operations may perform
  a deliberate uncapped read before mutation; this preserves transcript data
  rather than allowing a partial UI window to overwrite older messages.
