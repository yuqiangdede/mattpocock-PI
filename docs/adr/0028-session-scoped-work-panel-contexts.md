# ADR 0028: Scope work-panel runtime contexts to conversations

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-07-27

## Context

The renderer previously owned one global work-panel tab set. Selecting another
conversation or workspace closed the panel and destroyed every tab, as required
by D128. That prevented relative resources from leaking into another workspace,
but it also discarded useful tools when the operator returned to a conversation.

Permission-gated tools exposed a race in that model. A tool could finish after
approval while another conversation was loading. If completion arrived before
the selection committed, its artifact briefly opened the global panel and was
then cleared, causing a visible resize flash. If it arrived afterward, the
background-session guard dropped the artifact entirely. BrowserPreview also
lost its originating session identity before reaching the renderer and could
resolve a relative path against the visible workspace.

## Decision

Each conversation owns a renderer-memory work-panel context containing its open
state, ordered tabs, active tab, file request, and Browser resource.

- Selecting a conversation saves the current projection and atomically restores
  the destination context. Switching away never deletes either context.
- New and forked conversations begin with an empty context. Deleting a
  conversation removes its retained context.
- Review and BrowserPreview artifacts are recorded against their originating
  `sessionId`, including while that conversation is in the background.
- Background artifacts update retained state only. They do not open, activate,
  navigate, resize, or focus the visible panel.
- BrowserPreview events carry `sessionId`. Electron Main resolves local preview
  paths from that durable session's `projectPath`, and navigation occurs only
  when the originating conversation's Browser tab is visible.
- Selecting a workspace without an active conversation hides the current panel
  projection while retaining the prior conversation's state.
- Work-panel contexts remain transient. Relaunch discards them; only panel width
  remains persisted.

This adopts D142 and supersedes only D128's requirement to close and clear tabs
on visible session/workspace changes. D128's artifact triggers, deduplication,
and close/collapse rules remain unchanged; its no-launcher rule is amended by
ADR 0068. Electron Main, preload IPC, and renderer ownership boundaries remain
unchanged.

## Consequences

- Returning to a conversation restores its tools without reinterpreting paths
  against another workspace.
- Permission completion and asynchronous navigation no longer produce a
  transient panel open/close cycle or lose the resulting artifact.
- The renderer retains bounded per-session UI state until deletion or relaunch;
  it does not add durable storage or schema migration.
- The embedded browser remains one hardened Main-process WebContentsView. Its
  visible resource follows the selected conversation rather than allowing a
  background preview to navigate the foreground view.
- Terminal process/cache ownership remains workspace-scoped under ADR 0019;
  only the tab's presentation context becomes conversation-scoped.

## Alternatives

### Keep clearing tabs on every context change

Rejected because it loses task continuity and cannot avoid both permission
completion flashes and dropped background artifacts.

### Persist panel contexts in host storage

Rejected because tabs and Browser resources are transient presentation state.
Durability would require schema, cleanup, and stale-resource policies without
improving the reported in-process workflow.

### Key every backend panel subsystem by conversation

Rejected for this change. Review is workspace truth and Terminal intentionally
remains workspace-scoped under ADR 0019. Conversation ownership is required for
the visible tab context and BrowserPreview routing, not every backend resource.
