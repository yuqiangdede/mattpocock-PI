# ADR 0071: Adopt an Apple-Inspired Global Corner Hierarchy

- Status: Accepted for implementation
- Date: 2026-08-11
- Deciders: PI-Desktop core
- Related: D072, D210

## Context

PI-Desktop enforced a shared radius-token scale, but that scale preserved a
collection of historical 5/6/7/8/10/12/14/16/18/22px values. The one-pixel
steps at the compact end were difficult to distinguish, and the shared button
primitive used a capsule even though most of its 28–32px actions belong to a
dense desktop interface.

Apple's current design guidance separates fixed rounded rectangles, capsules,
and concentric shapes. It continues to use rounded rectangles for Mini, Small,
and Medium macOS controls, reserves capsules for emphasis and appropriate
component families, and defines a concentric child radius from its containing
radius and inset. Applying that geometry is more important than copying one
radius across every component.

The renderer is pinned to Electron 37 / Chromium 138. CSS `corner-shape` and
its `squircle` value ship in Chromium 139, so relying on them would silently
fall back in the packaged application.

## Decision

1. Replace the fixed-radius ladder with
   4/6/8/10/12/14/16/18/20/24px values. Keep `--radius-full` for capsules and
   `--radius-round` for circles.
2. Standard compact and medium controls use fixed rounded rectangles. The
   shared button and field primitives use `--radius-sm` (10px).
3. Pills, badges, segmented selections, switches, tracks, status dots, and
   equal-width circular icon controls keep their explicit capsule or circle
   geometry.
4. Surfaces increase radius with size and elevation. When a child corner sits
   near and parallel to a rounded container corner, use the concentric relation
   `outer radius = inner radius + inset`.
5. Full-width structural shell surfaces remain square at the window edge.
6. The composer aliases its established 20px radius to `--radius-xl`, keeping
   the visible composer geometry while bringing it into the global ladder.
7. D072's token-only lint enforcement remains unchanged; only the frozen pixel
   values and shared primitive assignments are amended.

## Consequences

- The interface has a more legible small-to-large corner hierarchy, while
  compact macOS controls no longer look uniformly pill-shaped.
- Existing token consumers receive the revised values globally without
  component-local literals.
- Designers and implementers must choose pill or circle tokens intentionally
  instead of treating them as a default radius.
- True continuous-corner rendering remains unavailable until the packaged
  Chromium runtime supports `corner-shape`; the compatible fallback is the
  standardized fixed-radius ladder.

## Alternatives considered

### Make every component a capsule

Rejected because Apple retains rounded rectangles for compact macOS controls
and uses capsules selectively for emphasis and specific control families.

### Add `corner-shape: squircle` now

Rejected because the packaged Chromium 138 runtime does not support it. A
declaration that only works in newer development browsers would make visual
verification and shipped behavior diverge.

### Keep the historical values and change individual components

Rejected because the request is global, and retaining closely spaced 5/6/7/8px
steps would continue to make the hierarchy hard to perceive and maintain.

## Addendum (2026-08-14): the `corner-shape` blocker is gone

The Context and Alternatives above are left as recorded. Their runtime premise
no longer holds: the shell moved to Electron 43, which bundles Chromium 150, and
`CSS.supports("corner-shape", "squircle")` returns `true` in the packaged
renderer. The deferral in Consequences and the "Add `corner-shape: squircle`
now" rejection were both about availability alone, so nothing stands in the way
of revisiting them.

This addendum does not change the decision. The fixed-radius ladder stays as
specified; adopting continuous corners is a design change that needs its own
decision, not a side effect of a dependency bump.
