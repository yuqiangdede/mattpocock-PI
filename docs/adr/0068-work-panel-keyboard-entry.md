## Context

D128 made the work panel artifact-only and explicitly removed a global
shortcut. That keeps startup quiet, but it leaves a user with no direct way to
return to a session's retained panel after collapsing it or closing its last
resource. The existing panel header already provides the resource chooser, so
the missing capability is panel entry rather than a new resource protocol.

## Decision

1. Add the shared `openWorkPanel` shortcut with a default `Cmd/Ctrl + J`
   binding. The existing shortcut settings surface can override and reset it
   using the same conflict and reserved-key validation as other shortcuts.
2. When an active session exists, the shortcut sets that session's retained
   panel context to open at its committed width without creating or activating a
   resource tab. Existing tabs, active resource, and Browser resource remain
   unchanged.
3. The empty panel header remains the manual resource chooser for Review,
   Terminal, Browser, and Files. Artifact triggers continue to create and
   activate resources atomically, and background-session artifacts cannot open
   the visible panel.
4. The shortcut is ignored while Settings is active and is a no-op without an
   active session. No host protocol, IPC channel, or native application-menu
   command is added.

## Consequences

- Users can reopen the work panel without waiting for another artifact.
- Opening the panel no longer implies that a resource exists; the empty header
  is an intentional chooser state.
- The change remains renderer-local and preserves session-scoped ownership,
  width reservation, and startup reset behavior.
- macOS application menus remain unchanged; the shortcut is discoverable and
  editable in Settings → Shortcuts.

## Alternatives considered

### Keep artifact-only entry

Rejected. A collapsed or last-resource-closed panel could not be reopened
directly even though its session context remained valid.

### Make `Cmd/Ctrl + J` a toggle

Rejected. Collapse already has a dedicated panel control, and an explicit open
action avoids accidentally hiding the panel while the user is trying to reveal
its tools.

### Create Review on shortcut

Rejected. A shortcut should reveal the work surface without fabricating a
workspace change resource or imposing a default tool choice.
