# ADR 0093: Keep a strict 46px plugin drag band with a minimal capsule

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-08-17
- Deciders: PI-Desktop core

## Context

The plugin-owned panel surface introduced a compact host capsule, but its
layout contract must remain explicit. Frameless windows still need a reliable
drag area, and the top band cannot receive plugin clicks. The host must not
grow that band for a title, a platform-specific control row, or decorative
chrome. Development authors also need a visible reminder of the constraint.

## Decision

1. Every plugin panel reserves exactly 46 CSS px for the transparent host drag
   band. Normal-flow content is offset by that same value; fixed and sticky
   plugin UI uses `--pi-plugin-titlebar-height: 46px`.
2. The drag band uses `-webkit-app-region: drag` and blocks plugin pointer
   interaction across those 46px. The host capsule opts out with
   `-webkit-app-region: no-drag`, so its three buttons remain clickable.
3. The host renders no panel title. Development panels show a localized,
   non-interactive reminder that the top 46px is drag-only outside the capsule;
   production panels do not show the reminder.
4. The capsule stays fixed at the top-right inside the 46px band and remains a
   minimal closed-Shadow-DOM surface: three controls, a subtle border and
   page-adaptive background, with no heavy shadow or blur effect. Its private
   sender-validated window-control channel, localized labels, focus behavior,
   reduced-motion behavior, and `window.pluginBridge` remain unchanged.

## Consequences

- Plugin authors get a stable 46px layout and interaction contract on every
  desktop platform.
- The top band is intentionally unavailable to plugin buttons except for the
  host capsule; plugin toolbars should use the documented drag/no-drag rules.
- Development authors see the constraint while production panels keep the
  surface quiet.
- The capsule has less visual weight and cannot extend beyond the drag band.

## Alternatives

### Let the drag band grow with the capsule

Rejected because a variable host band would change plugin layout and make the
same panel differ across platforms or future chrome revisions.

### Let plugin content receive clicks in the drag band

Rejected because frameless window dragging would become unreliable and authors
could mistake the top strip for ordinary interactive content.

### Restore a host-rendered panel title

Rejected because the plugin owns the visible panel hierarchy; the host only
needs the three native window actions and the development constraint reminder.
