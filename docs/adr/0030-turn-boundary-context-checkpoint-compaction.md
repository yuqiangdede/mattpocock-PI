# ADR 0030: Turn-boundary context checkpoint compaction

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-07-28

## Context

A long pi agent run can contain many model/tool turns before `agent_end`.
Compacting only between user prompts or after the run is already terminal does
not protect the next provider request inside that loop. The observed Bedrock
failure reached 1,077,172 tokens against a 1,000,000-token provider maximum,
so the provider rejected the request before PI-Desktop had a recovery point.

pi-agent-core already supplies session-context reconstruction, token
estimation, cut-point selection, summary generation, retained-tail handling,
and compaction records. It does not define PI-Desktop's renderer lifecycle,
Rust-owned persistence, provider-headroom policy, or long-loop guard.

OpenCode Dynamic Context Pruning (DCP), inspected at commit
`85b6f5ceba144fee9e65eb28dc36cab1b960e418`, demonstrates useful behavioral
patterns: evaluate context each turn, inject deduplicated guidance before the
emergency boundary, and let the model request context management. It is an
OpenCode plugin under AGPL-3.0, so directly linking or copying it would add an
incompatible runtime and licensing boundary to PI-Desktop.

## Decision

PI-Desktop uses pi-agent-core's public compaction primitives and independently
implements the desktop-specific controller.

- The controller runs after every `turn_end` and before pi starts another
  provider request. `turn_end` is a model/tool-turn boundary; only `agent_end`
  or `error` ends the overall desktop run.
- Budgeting uses the pi-ai model context/output limits. Request headroom is at
  least the configured reserve, the model output allowance capped at 25% of
  context, or 5% of context. A configured reserve cannot consume more than
  half the window. The retained-tail target cannot exceed half the remaining
  hard budget, so small-window models remain compactable.
- At the soft boundary, a transient system instruction asks the model to call
  `CompactContext` with the active-task focus. It is eligible only after tool
  turns and repeats at most once every three qualifying turns. The instruction
  is not persisted and does not mutate the durable system prompt.
- `CompactContext` bypasses the Rust tool/permission bridge because it changes
  model context, not the workspace. Its call and result use normal tool events
  and remain visible/durable as a tool activity row. The requested checkpoint
  is generated only after that tool turn finishes, preserving provider-valid
  call/result pairing.
- At the hard boundary, the runtime generates a checkpoint deterministically.
  The candidate context is re-estimated before persistence and again before
  continuation. Failure or an ineffective checkpoint stops the loop before
  another provider request with `CONTEXT_COMPACTION_FAILED`.
- A final tool-result batch is kept with its assistant tool-call carrier. If
  that atomic batch exceeds the normal retained-tail target, the runtime lets
  pi move the cut point to the carrier while keeping the effective tail bounded
  to half the hard budget. A still-larger indivisible batch is blocked rather
  than sent above the provider limit.
- An exact provider overflow is a final safety net. The failed assistant stays
  visible for diagnosis but is removed from model context; the runtime creates
  one checkpoint and retries the model request once. A second overflow is
  terminal.
- Automatic protection is enabled by default. Disabling it removes the model
  tool and disables threshold and overflow recovery. Manual `/compact` remains
  available for an idle session.
- Protocol v6 adds a host-owned `session.appendCompaction` operation and
  compaction lifecycle events. The host appends a typed checkpoint line to the
  session JSONL file. Visible messages are never deleted, rewritten, or hidden
  by context compaction.
- Only the newest valid checkpoint rebuilds model context. Transcript rewrites
  preserve it only while its boundary remains present. Forks copy and remap it
  only when the fork includes that boundary.

## Consequences

- Long tool loops receive context checks at the only boundary that can protect
  the next request without interrupting an active model or tool call.
- The deterministic hard guard does not depend on the model obeying a reminder.
- Restart and model changes retain compacted working context without changing
  the human-readable conversation.
- Compaction itself is one extra provider request and can fail; its lifecycle
  is explicit, abortable, and surfaced through stable error codes.
- Provider token accounting on retained assistant messages is cleared while
  reconstructing a checkpoint, because that usage described the pre-compacted
  request and would otherwise overcount the restored context.
- OpenCode DCP updates do not flow into PI-Desktop automatically. Any future
  behavioral adoption requires a fresh independent implementation review.

## Alternatives

### Integrate OpenCode DCP directly

Rejected because it targets OpenCode's plugin hooks and persistence model and
is AGPL-3.0. PI-Desktop needs a Rust-host durability contract and pi-specific
turn lifecycle, so an adapter would retain most of the implementation cost
while adding license and upgrade coupling.

### Use pi compaction only at `agent_end`

Rejected because no `agent_end` occurs between tool turns in one long run. The
next provider request can already be oversized.

### Rely only on a model reminder

Rejected because the model may ignore, postpone, or repeat the request. Soft
guidance is useful for summary focus but cannot enforce the provider limit.

### Delete older visible transcript messages

Rejected because context management must not destroy user history, revision
families, fork inputs, searchability, or diagnostics.
