- Amends: ADR 0062 (the `Task` tool contract) and ADR 0089 (the delegation
  lifecycle). Both are preserved — every existing boundary still holds; this
  adds one opt-in parameter and one piece of bookkeeping.
- Tracking: #513

## Context

Delegation as built by ADR 0062 and ADR 0089 spawns one `SubagentRun` per `Task`
call. Each run starts with `messages: []` (`packages/agent-runtime/src/subagent.ts`)
and is single-use. A delegate's transcript rows are persisted — they carry
`parentToolCallId` and `agentName` and land in the session transcript — but
nothing ever reads them back into a delegate, and the session runtime skips them
when it rebuilds model context (`runtime.ts`, `if (m.parentToolCallId) continue;`).

That makes every `Task` call a cold start even when the parent delegates the
same subagent for the same files twice. The context the first run bought —
which files it read, what it found, what it already changed — is discarded, and
the second run pays for it again, or worse, works from a stale file version it
never re-reads.

The pieces to do better are already in place: the rows are persisted with
enough fidelity for a full rebuild (tool call/result pairs, thinking blocks, and
the original `Task` arguments on the tool row), and the session runtime already
contains a `UiMessage[] → AgentMessage[]` converter that produces well-formed
provider messages including synthesized carriers for orphan tool rows.

## Decision

Add an opt-in `resume` parameter to the `Task` tool. When present, the new
delegation is seeded with the prior delegation's reconstructed context instead
of starting empty.

### 1. `Task` gains `resume?: delegationId`

Resolution is by `delegationId` only — the id the `Task` result already returns
and `TaskWait` already accepts. A second, stable internal key
(`delegateSessionId`) exists solely to chain the runs; it never appears in a
tool parameter, tool result, or prompt. The runtime keeps a reverse map from
every `delegationId` issued on a live chain to that chain, so an id from the
middle of a chain resolves too.

### 2. Chains, not records, are the unit of resumability

A **chain** is one `delegateSessionId` plus the ordered `Task` toolCallIds that
belong to it. Each `resume` appends the new toolCallId. Child transcript rows
are keyed by `parentToolCallId`, so reconstructing a chain's context means
selecting every row whose `parentToolCallId` is in the chain and whose
`agentName` matches.

`DelegationRecord` gains `delegateSessionId`, `toolCallIdChain`, `resumable`,
`readFiles`, and `readLineCount`. The registry keeps a secondary index from
`delegateSessionId` to the chain's live record.

### 3. Context reconstruction is a pure function

A new module (`packages/agent-runtime/src/delegation-history.ts`) owns:

- selecting the chain's rows from the session transcript,
- synthesizing the original `task` as the first user message from the first
  `Task` tool row's persisted arguments,
- converting to `AgentMessage[]` with the delegate's own provider/model binding
  (a pinned delegation model is not the session model),
- a read-file / line-count budget gate.

`SubagentRun` gains `initialMessages?: AgentMessage[]`; when present it seeds
`initialState.messages` instead of `[]`. The run is otherwise a completely
normal run: it occupies a `MAX_SUBAGENT_CONCURRENCY` slot, inherits the
definition's permission scope, and settles through the existing
`settleDelegation` path with its own `delegationId`, report, and counters.

### 4. Validation is visible, never thrown

`resume` is validated before the run starts; every failure is a tool error the
model can act on:

| Condition | Error |
|---|---|
| unknown or evicted id | `Unknown delegation "<id>"` plus the current resumable list |
| still running | `Delegation <id> is still running; call TaskWait to converge first` |
| `stopped` / `aborted` | not resumable; a future revive path (out of scope here) |
| `Task.agent` differs from the chain's agent | name mismatch, lists available |
| `Task.model` present on a resume | not allowed on a resumed run — start a new delegation to change models |
| chain exceeds the read budget | the chain is excluded from the resumable list, so this surfaces as unknown id |

No new error codes for "evicted" versus "never existed": both resolve to the
same unknown-id error, because the model's only correct action is identical.

### 5. Only `completed` and `failed` are resumable

A `failed` run's reads and findings still have value; its failed assistant row
is dropped by the converter like any other error row. `stopped` and `aborted`
encode the user's or the parent's decision to abandon that line of work, and
resuming it would contradict the stop. (`timed_out` is a vestigial status —
ADR 0119's timeouts were withdrawn by D328 — and is treated as `failed` for this
purpose.)

### 6. One live record per chain, ever

There is no queuing and no message-append. A chain has at most one running
record at a time; a `resume` while the chain is running is rejected with the
TaskWait error above. This keeps the chain a strict straight line with no
forking successors.

### 7. Resumable chains are bounded, LRU, per agent name

`MAX_RESUMABLE_CHAINS_PER_AGENT = 2`. Chains are exempt from the existing
`pruneFinishedDelegations` oldest-first sweep while under this bound; exceeding
it evicts the least-recently-used whole chain (record, chain index, and reverse
map entries together). Tombstones are unnecessary: `delegationId` is a random
UUID, so an evicted id cannot collide with a future one.

### 8. Read budget gates chain growth

A delegate has no compaction of its own, so an unbounded chain would eventually
overflow its own context window. Rather than trimming inside the chain, a chain
whose cumulative read volume exceeds `MAX_RESUMABLE_READ_LINES` (50,000) silently
leaves the resumable list — the next delegation for that work is a cold start,
which still works. The gate is checked when the resumable list is built, so it
costs nothing at delegation time.

Reads are counted from the delegate's read-only tool rows (`Read`, `Glob`,
`Grep`, `BrowserPreview`), accumulated per chain; write-tool targets are not
counted and not listed.

### 9. The parent sees a resumable list in its system prompt

Each prompt composes the current resumable chains into the parent's system
prompt: agent name, delegation id, the one-line objective, and the files the
chain has read (capped at 8, truncated). Only settled, in-budget chains appear —
a running chain is never listed, so the parent is not lured into resuming one.

The `resume` parameter's own schema description carries the rule that reuse
requires the id; prose alone does not resume anything.

### 10. Same session only

`resume` resolves only against the current session's transcript. There is no
cross-session addressing; sharing facts between conversations stays in the
prompt, as ADR 0165 concluded when it withdrew the peer stack.

### 11. Definition edits take effect on resume, with a diagnostic

A definition edited between two delegations is applied as-is on resume — the
same "editing takes effect on the next prompt" semantics the catalog already
has — and the change is recorded in the delegation's lifecycle details. No
definition snapshot is stored; snapshots would need new persistent state and
would contradict the existing semantics.

### 12. Chain index is rebuilt from the transcript on startup

The chain registry is in memory, but the chain relationship is recoverable:
`Task` tool rows are persisted with their arguments, including `resume`. At
session launch the runtime scans the transcript's `Task` rows, groups them by
their `resume` links into chains, and rehydrates the secondary index. Restart
does not lose resumability.

### 13. The transcript renders a chain as one continuous conversation

A resumed delegation's card shows the whole chain's rows as consecutive turns
(task → reply → task → reply) with no special "resumed" badge. The new run's
counters start at zero; `details.resumedFrom` keeps the link auditable.

## Consequences

- `Task`'s parameter schema widens by one optional field. Every existing call is
  unchanged: `resume` omitted is exactly today's behavior.
- The delegate→parent context boundary is untouched. Reconstructed rows seed the
  delegate's own context only; the parent still receives nothing but reports
  through `TaskWait`, and `parentToolCallId` rows are still skipped when the
  parent's context is rebuilt.
- No new storage schema, tables, or event types. The required fields
  (`delegateSessionId`, `toolCallIdChain`, `resumable`, read tracking) live on
  the in-memory `DelegationRecord`; `resumedFrom` rides the existing lifecycle
  details projection.
- A resumed run is billed and bounded exactly like a fresh one — same concurrency
  slot, same permission scope, same fallback models, same abort sources.
- Failure mode of the read budget is graceful degradation to a cold start, never
  a broken or oversized request.

## Out of scope (二期)

- Reviving a `stopped` / `aborted` delegation.
- In-chain compaction or placeholder substitution for old tool results.
- Task queuing / work append on a running delegation.
- Cross-session resumption.
- User-visible settings for the bounds; they stay code constants.
