# ADR 0097: Place global defaults under the AI settings destination

## Context

The flat Settings directory removed redundant navigation levels, but the
Basics page still owned a Defaults card containing the default operating mode,
command shell, and Enter-to-send preference. These controls change agent
behavior rather than application appearance, so their location made the
Basics page mix visual preferences with global AI behavior.

## Decision

Keep the eight-destination Settings directory unchanged. Basics owns the
Appearance card and platform-supported close behavior. The **全局 AI / AI**
destination owns the Permissions card and the Defaults card, whose rows are:

- default operating mode (Agent / Plan / Goal)
- command shell selection and its host-backed fallback status
- Enter-to-send

The Model configuration destination continues to own the default provider/model
selector because it is coupled to provider readiness and model identity. This
change only moves renderer content and Settings search ownership; persisted
settings, host APIs, runtime semantics, and deep-link contracts do not change.

## Consequences

- Basics has a focused visual and application-preference scope.
- Global AI presents the behavior controls users expect to affect agent turns.
- Settings search routes mode, command shell, and Enter-to-send queries to AI.
- Existing persisted settings and runtime behavior remain unchanged.

## Alternatives

### Keep Defaults in Basics

Rejected because the card mixes appearance with agent execution behavior.

### Add a separate Behavior destination

Rejected because it would expand the flat directory for three closely related
controls that already have a clear owner in AI.

### Move the controls to Model configuration

Rejected because operating mode, command shell, and Enter-to-send are global
interaction behavior and do not depend on provider/model readiness.
