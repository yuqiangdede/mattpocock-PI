# ADR 0058: Extensions Page Density and Theme-Readable Button Surfaces

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-08-05
- **Decision:** D196

## Context

The Extensions destination grew from a two-tab plugin surface into four
distinct surfaces: Installed, MCP, Skills, and Marketplace. The four-number
overview band retained derived counts that were already represented by tab,
group, and update states, consuming vertical space without adding a decision
point. The shared button primitive also relied on gray-scale aliases and
transparent text-mix fills, which made secondary actions and theme transitions
too weak in dark mode.

## Decision

1. Remove the numeric overview band and its four derived counters from the
   Extensions page. Keep the four tabs, relevant tab counts, installed state
   groups, and pending-update alert as the actionable information hierarchy.
2. Define shared primary and secondary buttons with semantic theme tokens:
   primary buttons use `--ds-accent` and `--ds-bg-primary`; secondary buttons
   use `--ds-bg-secondary`, `--ds-text-primary`, and `--ds-border-default`.
   Hover states use `--ds-accent-hover` and `--ds-bg-tertiary`.
3. Treat this as a renderer presentation change only. Plugin, MCP, skill,
   marketplace, permission, host, protocol, and storage contracts do not
   change.

## Consequences

- The page header and segmented control reach the useful content sooner and
  preserve more space for extension rows, cards, and editors.
- The source of truth for counts remains close to the surface it describes.
- Primary and secondary actions have an opaque, theme-correct surface and a
  visible semantic edge in both dark and light themes.
- Any future overview summary must introduce a distinct action or decision
  point rather than repeating tab or group state.

## Alternatives considered

- Keep the overview band and reduce it to two cards: rejected because it still
  duplicates state and leaves the four-tab hierarchy uneven.
- Fix only the Extensions page buttons: rejected because the shared `Button`
  primitive is used across the app and the contrast defect is systemic.
- Add hard-coded per-theme colors: rejected because it would bypass the
  semantic token contract and make future theme changes harder.
