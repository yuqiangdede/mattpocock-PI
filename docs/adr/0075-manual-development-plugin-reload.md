# ADR 0075: Manual reload for development-plugin permission ceilings

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-08-12

## Context

Development plugins are watched and hot-reloaded from their local folders. The
watcher intentionally refuses a manifest that adds permissions beyond the
ceiling approved when the folder was loaded. Before this action existed, the
developer had to load the folder again through the picker to review the changed
manifest and resume development.

## Decision

Add a renderer-to-main `pi-desktop/plugin/reload` invoke channel. Electron main
resolves the plugin id through the host registry, loads the registered path with
the registry's current permissions, and re-arms the development watcher after a
successful load. The Plugins page exposes the action only for `source: "dev"`
rows and refreshes its list after the invoke completes.

The automatic watcher remains conservative: it cannot widen the permission
ceiling. A manual reload is an explicit developer action that acknowledges the
current manifest and makes its declared permissions the new ceiling for later
automatic reloads.

## Consequences

- Developers can recover from permission-gated hot reloads without re-picking a
  folder.
- Installed and marketplace plugins do not gain a manual reload control.
- The existing watcher, plugin runtime, and host-core storage contracts remain
  unchanged; the new channel is an additive Electron IPC surface.

## Alternatives considered

- Reusing the folder picker: rejected because it repeats path selection and
  makes recovery needlessly disruptive.
- Allowing automatic reloads to widen permissions: rejected because file edits
  must not silently grant new capabilities.
