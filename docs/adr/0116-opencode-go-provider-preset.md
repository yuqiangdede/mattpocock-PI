# ADR 0116: Add OpenCode Go as a Fixed Provider Preset

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-08-24
- Deciders: PI-Desktop core
- Updates ADR 0012 and ADR 0020

## Context

The OpenCode Go service exposes an OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions API, but
its endpoint is service-owned and should not be edited like a generic gateway.
Users should be able to configure it without copying an endpoint from separate
documentation, while the existing provider studio must continue to support
arbitrary OpenAI-compatible services.

## Decision

Add `opencode_go` as a persisted API-style value and expose it in the custom
provider dialog. Selecting it applies these immutable connection defaults:

```text
name:    OpenCode Go
baseUrl: https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1
```

The renderer keeps the name and endpoint visible but read-only, accepts the
API key as the only editable connection field, and continues to use the normal
discovered-model selector. Save-time normalization also enforces the fixed
values so stale or manually constructed form state cannot override them.

The runtime maps `opencode_go` to pi-ai's OpenAI Chat Completions adapter. Model
discovery calls `/models` with a Bearer key. Secrets remain owned by the
existing Rust host secret store; no OpenCode-specific secret or database table
is introduced.

## Consequences

- OpenCode Go is recognizable in the provider row and durable configuration.
- The service cannot be accidentally pointed at a different endpoint while the
  preset is selected.
- Generic OpenAI-compatible configuration remains available as a separate API
  style for user-controlled gateways.
- The preset does not create a second wire adapter or constrain the service's
  model list to a hardcoded catalog.
