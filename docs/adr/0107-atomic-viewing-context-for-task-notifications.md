# ADR 0107: Make current-session task notification suppression atomic

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-08-20
- Deciders: PI-Desktop core
- Related: D117, D135, E2E-064, E2E-065, `03-runtime/01-ipc-protocol.md`

## Context

Task completion has two renderer-visible effects: the transcript receives an
agent lifecycle event, and Electron may receive a durable notification from
`session.endTurn`. The renderer previously treated every `agent_end` or terminal
`error` event as an unread sidebar outcome, even when the focused current chat
was already showing that result. Separately, the active-session viewing hint
was delivered by an asynchronous React effect, so a fast turn could finish
before Electron received the hint.

## Decision

1. Treat unread `task.completed` and `task.failed` notification records as the
   sole source of terminal sidebar marks. Agent lifecycle events continue to
   drive running state, transcript updates, and the in-chat turn result card,
   but never create an unread sidebar outcome by themselves.
2. Carry an optional `viewingSessionId` snapshot on renderer-originated
   `agent/prompt` requests. Electron validates that it exactly matches the
   requested session and installs it before asynchronous turn setup. Missing,
   null, or mismatched snapshots clear the hint and fail safe to notification.
3. Keep the existing viewing-context IPC and Main-owned visibility/focus gate.
   Suppression is allowed only for the exact finishing session in a visible,
   focused window; background, hidden, unfocused, or unknown state creates the
   durable notification and preserves native delivery behavior.

## Consequences

- A focused user who remains in a conversation sees the transcript completion
  without a duplicate sidebar mark, inbox row, or native notification.
- Background and unfocused sessions retain durable and native recovery notices.
- The prompt request gains one additive optional field; older callers that omit
  it fail safe rather than suppressing a result using stale renderer state.
- Sidebar outcome state becomes consistent with the notification inbox and its
  read/acknowledgement lifecycle.

## Alternatives considered

### Hide the completed icon only for the selected row

Rejected: this would leave stale unread state in the store and would not prevent
durable or native notifications.

### Rely only on the React viewing-context effect

Rejected: the effect is asynchronous and can lose a race with a fast completion
or renderer navigation. The prompt-time snapshot closes the dispatch boundary
without trusting renderer focus or bypassing Main's fail-safe checks.
