# ADR 0256: Preserve DeepSeek reasoning across context compaction

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-09-15
- Deciders: PI-Desktop core
- Amends: D389 / ADR 0136 / ADR 0064
- Fixes: #296

## Context

DeepSeek thinking mode requires every replayed Completions assistant message to
carry a reasoning field (`reasoning_content`, or `reasoning_text` /
`reasoning` on some relays). Official `deepseek.com` endpoints accept `""` for
turns that produced no thinking (D389 / #223). OpenCode and third-party relays
for DeepSeek V4.1 Flash reject empty echoes with HTTP 400 ("reasoning_text must
be passed back").

Codex-shaped compaction (ADR 0064 / ADR 0136) drops assistant turns from the
retained tail so tool-call pairs cannot strand and completed user prompts do
not look like new tasks. That also drops thinking. Reloading a session rebuilds
assistant content from `UiMessage.thinking` without a Completions
`thinkingSignature`, so convertMessages silently omits the reasoning field and
the #223 empty backfill fills `""` — which strict relays reject.

## Decision

1. History rebuild stamps `thinkingSignature: "reasoning_content"` on restored
   thinking blocks so usable reasoning survives restart.
2. Checkpoints for models with `requiresReasoningContentOnAssistantMessages`
   store the last few thinking turns in opaque `details.retainedReasoning`
   (text + thinking only, no tool calls). Session context injects those turns
   between the compaction summary and the user tail.
3. The pi-ai patch backfills the reasoning field already present on the history
   (`reasoning_content` | `reasoning_text` | `reasoning`). Official DeepSeek
   URLs keep empty-string fill. Non-official DeepSeek-family Completions rows
   set `requiresNonEmptyReasoningReplay` and receive the documented placeholder
   `[reasoning not retained for this turn]` instead of `""`.
4. ADR 0136 retained-tail rules are unchanged: user-only tails, no tool-call
   replay.

## Consequences

- Post-compaction DeepSeek requests on OpenCode / aggregators keep real or
  placeholder reasoning and no longer 400 on empty echoes.
- Official DeepSeek and #223 empty-backfill behaviour remain available.
- Checkpoint `details` grow by a bounded reasoning excerpt; the visible
  transcript and host schema do not change.

## Alternatives

- Degrade to non-thinking mode after the 400: avoids the echo requirement but
  loses reasoning for that turn and hides the compaction gap.
- Put full assistant/tool messages back in `retainedTail`: preserves reasoning
  but reintroduces stranded tool calls and weakens the task boundary (rejected
  by ADR 0136).
