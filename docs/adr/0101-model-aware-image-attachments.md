# ADR 0101: Model-aware image attachment transport

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-08-18
- Deciders: PI-Desktop runtime and desktop UI maintainers

## Context

Clipboard images were materialized successfully, but the composer reduced every
file to `@<path>` text. A model that supports image input therefore received a
filesystem reference instead of an image block. The capability signal must be
owned by the same model catalog that pi-ai uses to serialize provider requests;
renderer discovery and user-entered model ids are not sufficient evidence.

## Decision

1. Keep the composer draft compact and textual. Each file reference retains its
   kind, name, MIME type, and source path as structured metadata; the visible
   textarea never contains pasted binary data.
2. Resolve vision capability from the exact pi-ai model record. Only
   `model.input.includes("image")` enables image transport. Unknown and custom
   model ids stay on the conservative non-vision path, even when discovery
   metadata claims `vision`.
3. Electron main remains the attachment boundary. It validates every source
   path against the session scratch root, the session-bound project root, or
   the content-addressed attachment root. Images are stored as
   `attachments/<sha256>` and the durable `UiMessage` stores only the reference
   and metadata.
4. For a vision-capable model, an image within the 20 MiB inline limit crosses
   the sidecar only as transient base64 data and becomes a pi-ai image content
   block. The base64 value is never persisted in SQLite, JSONL, or renderer
   transcript state.
5. For a non-vision model, an unknown model, or an image above the inline
   limit, the prompt receives a safe `@path` fallback. Replayed content-store
   images are copied into the session scratch `replayed/` directory before that
   fallback is exposed to the model.
6. The Composer shows a compact accessible status row when an image is attached:
   it states whether the selected model can receive visual input. The model
   picker and session/provider summaries expose the same authoritative vision
   capability.

## Consequences

- GPT/vision-capable models can inspect pasted images without requiring a
  model-specific renderer implementation.
- Text-only and non-vision models retain the existing file-tool workflow.
- Image bytes are deduplicated and can survive retry, fork, and runtime
  recreation without putting binary data in the transcript.
- Attachment garbage collection remains a later storage task; references are
  content-addressed so it can be added without changing the message contract.
- Full visual previews, drag-and-drop, image transforms, and provider-specific
  image limits remain out of scope. The 20 MiB inline threshold is an app-side
  safety bound; providers may impose stricter limits and return their normal
  provider error.

## Rejected alternatives

- **Always send `@path` text:** preserves non-vision behavior but cannot satisfy
  vision models.
- **Trust renderer/provider discovery flags:** can advertise a capability that
  the runtime adapter cannot serialize and would make unknown models unsafe to
  classify.
- **Persist base64 in messages:** makes reloads and SQLite/JSONL growth
  unbounded and crosses the persistence boundary unnecessarily.
