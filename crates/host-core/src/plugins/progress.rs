//! Progress an install reports while it runs, and the way a user cancels one.
//!
//! The install path is a single request: it resolves where the package is,
//! downloads it from one mirror after another, verifies it, extracts it and
//! registers it. Only the last step answers the caller, so a download that takes
//! a minute looks like a frozen window unless the work reports itself. That is
//! what an [`InstallObserver`] is for: the install calls it, and whoever owns
//! the interface decides what to do with it.
//!
//! Nothing here knows about JSON, RPC or the renderer on purpose: the caller
//! that emits an event is the RPC layer, and the tests use a recorder.
