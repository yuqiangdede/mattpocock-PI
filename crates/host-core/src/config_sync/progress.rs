//! Progress a sync reports while it runs.
//!
//! A sync is one request: it captures the local snapshot, reads the remote
//! revision, merges, uploads every resource object, publishes the head, applies
//! the result and cleans up history. The caller hears back only at the end, and
//! the upload is unbatched — one object per resource, two round trips each — so
//! a vault with a few hundred resources looks like a frozen window unless the
//! work reports itself. That is what a [`SyncProgressObserver`] is for.
//!
//! Nothing here knows about the interface on purpose. An observer is called by
//! the sync; the one that ships is [`ProgressNotifier`], which writes the same
//! NDJSON notification `configSync.changed` already uses, and tests install a
//! recorder.
