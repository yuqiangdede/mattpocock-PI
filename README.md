<sub>A standalone desktop workspace for coding agents, projects, models, tools, and long-running sessions.</sub>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **PI-Desktop is currently in Early Preview.**
>
> The project is actively developed and already usable for real coding workflows, but APIs, extension interfaces, and some desktop behaviors may continue to evolve.

## Why PI-Desktop?

Most coding agents live inside a terminal, an editor extension, or a hosted service.

PI-Desktop gives them a workspace of their own.

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 🖥️ Desktop-first

Work across repositories and sessions without tying your agent workflow to one editor or terminal.

Projects, conversations, reviews, files, previews, notifications, and extensions live in one workspace.

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### ✨ Bring your own model

Use OpenAI, Anthropic, local models, hosted gateways, or any OpenAI-compatible API.

Configure multiple providers and models, then switch between them per session.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 🔍 Inspectable by default

Agents can read files, edit code, and run commands — but privileged actions pass through PI-Desktop's permission layer.

Review diffs, inspect command output, and decide how much autonomy each session gets.

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 🧩 Built to extend

Add Skills, MCP servers, Subagents, and installable Plugins.

Plugins can contribute tools, commands, panels, themes, services, skills, and new workspace experiences.

## From prompt to patch

Getting started only takes a few steps:

1. **Connect a model**
   Open **Settings → Model configuration**, choose a provider or compatible API, and add your credentials.

2. **Open a project**
   Add any local repository or project directory from the sidebar.

3. **Pick Agent, Plan, or Goal**
   **Agent** starts working. **Plan** waits until you approve a frozen implementation plan. **Goal** waits until you approve the outcome, then the agent chooses the path.

4. **Review the result**
   Inspect edits in the Review panel, check command output, preview the application, and continue the conversation without leaving PI-Desktop.

---

## More than a chat window

### Agent, Plan, and Goal

Same agent. Three gates. Privileged tools still go through the permission layer in every mode.

| | **Agent** | **Plan** | **Goal** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| You approve | Nothing extra | The implementation plan | The outcome and acceptance criteria |
| The agent does | Reads, edits, runs commands, tests, iterates | Studies the repo, writes a frozen plan, then waits | Picks the path and works until the goal is met |
| Use when | You want it to just do the work | The change is large or risky and you want the approach first | You care about the result, not the route |

**Agent** is the default loop: inspect the tree, patch files, run commands, and keep going.

**Plan** is the approval boundary. The agent researches first and produces an immutable implementation plan. Execution does not start until you sign off.

**Goal** is outcome-first. You lock the objective and acceptance criteria; the agent decides how to get there.

---

### Delegate work to Subagents

Large tasks rarely belong in one context window.

PI-Desktop can delegate independent work to background Subagents for things like:

* codebase exploration
* multi-file implementation
* research and investigation
* test analysis
* adversarial review

Each Subagent runs in its own context and reports its result back to the parent agent.

---

### A workspace built for long sessions

PI-Desktop is designed for more than one prompt at a time.

You can manage multiple projects and sessions, pin or archive conversations, branch sessions, queue prompts while an agent is running, reference files with `@`, use slash commands, and search across the application.

Streaming responses are checkpointed so interrupted work can survive application restarts or runtime failures whenever possible.

---

## Your models, your choice

PI-Desktop does not lock the agent runtime to a hardcoded model list.

Use:

* OpenAI and Anthropic
* OpenAI-compatible APIs
* hosted model gateways
* local gateways such as Ollama and LM Studio
* multiple models under the same provider
* provider OAuth accounts where supported

Model configuration can include context windows, output limits, reasoning controls, temperature, and other model-specific behavior.

Switch models directly from the Composer without recreating your session.

---

## Review the work, not just the answer

The agent workspace includes dedicated surfaces for the things that matter while coding:

## Extensions without rebuilding the app

PI-Desktop has several extension layers depending on how deeply you want to customize the agent.

### Skills

Give agents reusable instructions and workflows.

Skills can be installed globally or activated for individual projects.

### MCP

Connect external tools and services through Model Context Protocol servers without baking them into the desktop application.

### Subagents

Create specialized agents with their own instructions, tools, and model choices, then delegate work to them from another agent.

### Plugins

Plugins can extend PI-Desktop itself with:

* agent tools
* commands
* workspace panels
* work-panel views
* Skills
* MCP servers
* Subagents
* themes
* resident services
* inter-plugin messaging

Plugins can be installed locally or through the marketplace using the `.piplug` package workflow.

> [!NOTE]
> Plugin processes are permission-gated and isolated from the renderer, but plugins are still user-trusted code rather than a complete operating-system sandbox. Only install plugins you trust.

## Local-first, precisely

PI-Desktop is **local-first**, not “nothing ever touches the network.”

| Data                 | Behavior                                                |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Conversations        | Stored locally as JSONL with a SQLite index             |
| Settings             | Stored on your machine                                  |
| API credentials      | Stored in the operating system keychain                 |
| Logs                 | Local                                                   |
| PI-Desktop telemetry | None                                                    |
| Model requests       | Sent directly to the provider or endpoint you configure |

There is no required PI-Desktop account and no mandatory PI-hosted relay between your machine and your model provider.

If you use a remote model provider, the context required for that model request is naturally sent to that provider according to its own privacy policy.

## Download

Download the latest build from **[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/vastsa/PI-Desktop/releases/latest)**.

| Platform | Architecture  | Package              |
| -------- | ------------- | -------------------- |
| macOS    | Apple Silicon | `.dmg` / `.zip`      |
| macOS    | Intel         | `.dmg` / `.zip`      |
| Windows  | x64           | NSIS installer       |
| Linux    | x64           | `.AppImage` / `.deb` / `.asar` |

Packaged builds can check GitHub Releases for updates and surface new versions inside the application. The Linux `.asar` asset is available for repackaging with a system Electron; launch it with `electron PI-Desktop-<version>-linux-x64.asar` after adding the native host and packaged resources required by the target distribution.

### Linux

Linux x64 packages need **glibc 2.35** or newer. That is the library shipped with:

* Ubuntu 22.04 or later
* Debian 12 or later
* Fedora 36 or later

Ubuntu 20.04, Debian 11, Fedora 35, and older releases cannot load the bundled host. Check with `ldd --version`.

### macOS

The tagged-release workflow signs, notarizes, and staples macOS artifacts with
Developer ID credentials before publication.

## Import your existing sessions

Already using another coding agent?

PI-Desktop can import local sessions from supported tools including:

* Claude Code
* Codex
* OpenCode
* Pi

Open **Settings → Import** to bring existing work into the desktop workspace.

---

## Architecture

PI-Desktop deliberately separates the user interface from privileged host capabilities and the agent loop.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    UI["React Renderer<br/>Chat · Projects · Reviews · Settings"]
    Electron["Electron Main<br/>Desktop orchestration"]
    Rust["Rust Host Core<br/>Permissions · Filesystem · SQLite · Secrets"]
    Agent["pi Agent Sidecar<br/>Agent loop · Models · Streaming"]
    Provider["Model Provider<br/>Cloud or Local"]

    UI --> Electron
    Electron --> Rust
    Electron --> Agent
    Agent <--> Rust
    Agent --> Provider
```

The renderer has no Node integration.

The **Rust Host Core** owns privileged workspace operations, permissions, persistence, and secrets. The **pi Agent Sidecar** owns model interaction and the agent loop. Electron coordinates the desktop lifecycle while keeping those responsibilities separated.

[Read the architecture specification →](docs/spec/02-architecture/01-architecture.md)

---

## Project status

PI-Desktop is an early preview under active development.

The current **0.14.x** line includes the desktop shell, streaming agent runtime, Agent / Plan / Goal workflows, permission-aware workspace tools, projects and sessions, session imports, MCP / Skills / Subagents, background delegation, multi-provider model configuration, plugins and marketplace support, context checkpoints, notifications, release notes, and cross-platform packaging.

Current priorities include:

* macOS tagged-release qualification
* installer upgrade and rollback qualification
* continued runtime and session-recovery hardening
* stronger plugin sandboxing and publisher verification
* broader UI-driven end-to-end coverage

Follow development through the [project board](docs/project/BOARD.md) and [milestones](docs/spec/06-delivery/01-mvp-milestones.md).
