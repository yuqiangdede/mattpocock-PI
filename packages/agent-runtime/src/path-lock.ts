/**
 * Serialize mutating tool calls that target the same file.
 *
 * The parent agent and its subagents run in one sidecar process but issue
 * `tools.execute` calls independently. host-core admits one mutation per
 * session at a time, so the writes themselves cannot tear; what it does not
 * give is a defined order for two same-path mutations, and the sidecar's own
 * per-path bookkeeping needs one. The edit-recovery contract counts failures
 * per path and terminates the second failed `Edit` for the same file, which
 * only means "read fresh content and try again" if the two attempts were
 * ordered. With subagents able to fan out (ADR 0062) they no longer are, so the
 * sidecar queues same-path mutations before they reach the host.
 *
 * Different paths never wait on each other, which is the point: fan-out stays
 * parallel except where the order matters.
