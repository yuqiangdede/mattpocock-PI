/**
 * Timing instrumentation for the agent turn loop (D137).
 *
 * A user reporting "running a command is slow" is almost never describing the
 * command: the wait is the approval prompt, the host round trip, or the model
 * round trip that follows every tool result. host-core logs its own three
 * segments; these lines cover the two the host cannot see — how long the
 * sidecar waited on `tools.execute` (approval included) and how long the
 * provider took before and during the next assistant message.
 *
 * Lines go to stderr, which the Electron main `Logger` wraps into the `agent`
 * channel of `~/.pi-desktop/logs/agent.log`.
