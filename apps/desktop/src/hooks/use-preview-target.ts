/**

 * completion the message body uses (`useOpenChatFileRef`, ADR 0262), so the
 * surface that named the file stops deciding where it shows: a tool row's
 * summary and a tool result's file/match list land in the bundled file view on
 * a project file exactly like a chat chip, and fall back the same way when the
 * view, the file, or the reference is not there. One opener for the whole
 * transcript is also what keeps a shorthand honest — a click opens the file
 * that matched, or reports that nothing did. HTTP(S) URLs follow the Link
 * open destination setting.

 * only `openimage.js` in its reply, and the open project answers before the
 * session's own scratch store does.
 *
 * Completion also picks how the file is addressed. A file in the project's
 * **primary** folder travels as a project-relative path, exactly as before; a
 * file in any other folder of the same project group (ADR 0249) can only be
 * named by its absolute path, and the file view switches its own folder to the
 * one that contains it. Scratch and attachment files are absolute too.
 *
 * A workspace `.html` page in the primary folder stays with the side browser
 * (ADR 0163): it is a page to run, not a file to read. A reference that matches
 * nothing says so instead of opening an empty panel.
