/**
 * The right-click action every file reference in the conversation shares.
 *
 * A reference the transcript already recognises as a file — a chip on a turn, an
 * inline code span, a link, a local image — is a file the user can open with one
 * click, so its menu offers the destination a click has no room for: the file's
 * own folder in the system file manager. The reference travels through the same
 * completion a click uses (`useRevealChatFileRef`, ADR 0262/0263), so a
 * reference that resolved to nothing says so instead of revealing a lookalike
 * somewhere else.
 *
 * Items are data, exactly as `ContextMenu` takes them: every surface keeps the
 * menu instance it already owns and shares only this vocabulary, so a row that
 * already has items of its own (a markdown link) adds this one instead of
 * opening a second surface.
