/**
 * A pointer-anchored context menu for renderer surfaces.
 *
 * `AnchoredMenu` places a surface against a control's rect, which a right-click
 * cannot provide, so this is the pointer-anchored member of the same family. It
 * follows the same rules every other renderer-owned dropdown follows: it
 * portals to `document.body` as a viewport-fixed layer (a transformed or
 * `overflow: hidden` ancestor cannot trap it), it is measured before it is
 * revealed so it never flashes at the viewport origin, it clamps inside the
 * viewport, and it closes on an outside press, Escape, or a scroll of anything
 * behind it. `is-open` gates visibility because a `visibility: hidden` surface
 * cannot take focus.
 *
 * Menus are data, not children: `useContextMenu` owns the open request, call
 * sites hand it a label plus items, and one mounted `<ContextMenu>` renders it.
 * That keeps exactly one such surface on screen and lets a row build its items
 * where the actions already live.

    A formula reads as its TeX source here too: Copy and Ctrl+C must not put
    two different readings of the same selection on the clipboard (issue #414).
    Read after the row check, so a selection this row does not own is never
    serialized at all.

    Read *here*, while the menu is opening, and not from the Copy item's own
    `onSelect`, even though that would reduce only when the user asks for it.
    The menu focuses its first item a frame after it opens (the
    `requestAnimationFrame` in `ContextMenu` below) and that collapses the
    range, so by the time an item runs there is no selection left to read.
    Deferring would mean carrying a cloned `Range` across the gap, where it
    goes stale while a turn is still streaming — a new failure mode traded for
    one clone. That clone is bounded by `mayContainKatex`, so only a row that
    actually renders math pays for it, and it is paid inside the frame the
    menu already spends before it can take focus. Menus whose items ignore the
    selection (a link's, in `Markdown.tsx`) pay it too; an opt-in flag on
    `ContextMenuRequest` would spare them and is not worth the public field.

    Read without a `try`/`catch`, deliberately. The only fallback a catch
    could reach for is the `live.toString()` below, which is the duplicated
    glyph reading issue #414 exists about — so swallowing here would turn a
    defect in the reduction into a silently wrong clipboard, the one outcome
    this module was written to remove. `markdown-blocks.ts` degrades rather
    than throwing for the opposite reason, not the same one: it runs in a
    render memo under the app's single root `ErrorBoundary`, where a throw
    replaces the whole window.

    The price here is smaller but it is not nothing, and naming it is the
    point: `openContextMenu` has already called `preventDefault` by the time
    this runs and has not called `setState` yet, so a throw costs the user
    this one right-click — no menu of ours, and no platform menu behind it
    either, since nothing registers `webContents.on("context-menu")`. Paid
    knowingly. A silently wrong clipboard is the failure that outlives the
    gesture; a menu that has to be opened twice is not. Reordering the
    snapshot above `preventDefault` would not buy a fallback back, only move
    which nothing happens.
