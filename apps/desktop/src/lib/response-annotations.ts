/**
 * Response annotations (ADR 0224 / D400, presentation amended by ADR 0225).
 *
 * The reference implementation (ChatGPT desktop app) does not put a quoted
 * excerpt into the composer as text. Selecting text in a response and choosing
 * "Add to chat" opens a compact comment editor and attaches a **numbered
 * annotation** to that response when it saves: a floating index and source
 * badges identify the selections, and the next prompt carries the excerpts in a
 * structured block the model reads as `Annotation 1`, `Annotation 2`, … in
 * array order. Source badges never modify the answer DOM; the model's own
 * `:codex-annotation{index="N"}` citation is rendered separately.
 *
 * This module owns that contract: the editor's open/save transitions, the wire
 * block the prompt carries, the request text a stored prompt reduces back to,
 * and the inline marker geometry.
