/**
 * The clipboard reading of a rendered selection that contains math.
 *
 * KaTeX paints one formula twice — a MathML tree for assistive technology and
 * a visual tree of positioned spans — and both are real text in the document.
 * The platform's own copy therefore writes a formula out as its glyphs, twice
 * over, and never as the source the answer was written in (issue #414). The
 * TeX the formula was built from is already in the document, in the MathML
 * `annotation`, so a selection that covers a formula is read from the
 * annotation instead of from the rendering.
 *
 * Only the formulas are rewritten. The prose, lists, tables and code blocks
 * around them are serialized by the platform itself — the reduced clone is
 * selected and read back through `Selection.toString()`, which is the
 * serializer a copy runs — so the rest of a selection that happens to contain
 * a formula keeps its browser reading except for the one syntax this module
 * makes load-bearing: touching fences are separated, and every dollar outside
 * a formula is escaped so it cannot pair with a fence written here — code
 * blocks included, because the serializer has already dropped their fences
 * and what reaches the clipboard from one is prose (see `renderedText`).
 * A hand-written walk of the tree
 * could only approximate those rules, and everywhere it fell short it would
 * silently rewrite content the platform already got right.
 *
 * ADR 0268 removed the selection overlay and the Quote action and rested that
 * removal on the OS clipboard being the substitute for quoting. This is that
 * substitute made honest, and nothing more: no surface, no store state, no
 * action-row item, and no new way to reach the clipboard. The copy the user
 * already performs writes different bytes when, and only when, the selection
 * contains a formula.
 *
 * The delimiters are the renderer's own: `lib/latex-math.ts` normalizes
 * `\(…\)` and `\[…\]` to `$…$` / `$$…$$` before `remark-math` runs, so a
 * formula copied out of an answer renders as that same formula when it is
 * pasted back into the composer.

 * Inline is the *narrow* run, `$…$`, even though `normalizeLatexMathDelimiters`
 * rewrites `\(…\)` to `$$…$$` — that form is forced on it by being
 * length-preserving, not chosen. The reason is not that a pasted sentence might
 * start a line with the formula: a single-line `$$…$$` never opens a display
 * block, because math flow forbids `$` in the meta that follows its opening
 * fence, so `$$x^2$$ here.` and even a bare `$$x^2$$` line both parse as text
 * math. The reason is that an inline formula's TeX can carry a newline —
 * `$a +\nb$` parses, and only the `\(…\)` path has its newlines flattened by
 * the normalization — and a `$$` run then lands at the start of a line with the
 * rest of the formula behind it, which *is* a flow opening and swallows the
 * paragraph. `$…$` spans the line ending instead, which is also why `texSlot`
 * needs `white-space: pre` for inline math and not only for display.
 *
 * The run is widened past any run inside the formula, which is the escalation
 * rule markdown already uses for code spans: `$\$5 + x$` closes at the escaped
 * dollar and pastes back as prose, while `$$\$5 + x$$` reads whole. Display
 * keeps a floor of two. The measure is the longest run anywhere in the formula
 * rather than a line-initial one, which over-widens a display fence that could
 * not have been closed early — cheaper than restating where a flow fence may
 * appear, and invisible to every formula that carries no `$` at all, which is
 * written exactly as it was before this rule existed.

 * What a formula becomes before the platform serializes the clone.
 *
 * `white-space: pre` because a bare text node would have the newlines inside
 * `$$ … $$` collapsed away like any other source whitespace, and a block slot
 * for display math because that is how it earns its own lines — both out of
 * the same rules that give the surrounding prose its breaks, rather than out
 * of newlines written into the text by hand.
 *
 * A paragraph, not a bare block: the serializer gives `p` a blank line on each
 * side and a `div` only a single break, so a `div` slot pastes back as
 * `$$ … $$\nLast paragraph.`, which reads as one run-on block.
 *
 * Display math is not always block-level here, and the slot is deliberately
 * left alone when it is not. `\[ … \]` is rewritten to `$$ … $$` in place —
 * the normalization is length-preserving — so `remarkLatexBracketDisplay`
 * promotes an *inline* math node and KaTeX paints `.katex-display` inside the
 * sentence's own `<p>`; the slot is then a `p` nested in a `p`, which is
 * invalid as markup and harmless here, because the clone is never serialized
 * as HTML (see `texClipboardPayload`) and only ever read through the text
 * serializer. That reading treats the nested block as one boundary and yields
 * `The result\n$$\nE = mc^2\n$$\n\ncloses the proof.` — a single newline above
 * `$$` is enough for `remark-math` to open the display block, so the formula
 * pastes back as the display formula it came from. Both `\[ … \]` shapes are
 * covered by E2E-CHAT-copy-formula-as-tex; do not "fix" the nesting without
 * re-running it.
 *
 * The block slot survives a table cell, which the grammar argues it should not
 * and which is therefore measured rather than reasoned about. The same
 * promotion puts `.katex-display` inside a `<td>`, and the table serializer
 * joins cells with tabs, so a `$$` fence there looks like it would be closed
 * by the tab after it and swallow the rest of the row —
 * `a\tb\n$$\nE = mc^2\n$$\t2` is one math node whose value runs to the end of
 * the line. Chromium writes no such string: a block box is a block boundary in
 * a cell too, the row breaks around it, and the fence closes on its own line.
 * Nor is the slot inventing that boundary, which is the half that decides it —
 * the platform's own reading of the same row carries no tab either, because
 * `.katex-display` breaks the row for it as well. Narrowing to the inline run
 * inside a cell would pay display math to repair a shape the serializer does
 * not produce, and would write a tab back that the platform does not. Both the
 * reading and the platform's parity are asserted by the `tableDisplay` case in
 * `scripts/e2e/copy-tex.tsx`, so a serializer that started tab-joining a cell
 * holding a block fails there rather than in a clipboard.

 * The platform's own reading of the reduced clone.
 *
 * The clone is selected and read back through `Selection.toString()` because
 * that is the serializer a copy actually runs, so the reduced selection is
 * read by the same code that read the original one: source line breaks
 * collapsed to spaces, `pre` kept byte for byte, one line per list item, tabs
 * between cells — and chrome the app marked `user-select: none` dropped.
 * `innerText` looks like the same reading and is not: it has no notion of
 * `user-select`, so it writes out the code block's language rail and the
 * action rows that `base.css` marks inert precisely so a copy leaves them
 * behind. Restating that rule here instead would be the hand-written walk this
 * module exists to avoid; running the platform's own serializer costs one
 * range and makes the parity exact rather than approximate.
 *
 * The reading needs layout, so the clone is attached off screen rather than
 * hidden — and attached inside the element the selection already lived in,
 * because for this serializer the cascade *is* the reading. `cloneContents`
 * keeps every ancestor below the range's common ancestor; mounting there
 * supplies the rest, so each ancestor-scoped rule resolves exactly as it did
 * live. That matters most for the one rule this module leans on: `base.css`
 * makes `html, body, #root` unselectable and has document-like surfaces opt
 * back in, so a clone parked on `body` reads back as the code blocks alone,
 * with every paragraph dropped. Restating the opt-in on the clone instead —
 * an inline `user-select: text` — looks like the cure and inverts the
 * contract: the default flips to selectable, and chrome that is inert only by
 * inheritance (a tool row's section head, a compact thinking row) arrives in
 * the clipboard. Borrowing the real ancestors settles both directions at once,
 * and does it without a second, duplicate-`id` copy of the chain under `body`.
 *
 * The wrapper is one element level the live tree does not have, so a rule
 * reaching the clone's top level through `>` or `:nth-child` misses it. Left
 * alone rather than engineered around, and on a fact rather than a law: the
 * reading turns on `display`, `white-space`, `visibility` and `user-select`,
 * and no rule in the app selects a direct child of a selection's common
 * ancestor to set one of them — the app's child combinators sit on chrome,
 * menus, settings and the composer, none of which renders a formula or reaches
 * this path. A rule that changed that would move one of the paragraph, list,
 * table or code readings in E2E-CHAT-copy-formula-as-tex, which is the guard;
 * rebuilding the ancestor chain to close the gap would trade it for a
 * duplicate-`id` clone and is not worth it. Mounting inside a React-rendered
 * parent is safe for the
 * same reason the swap below is: the node is added and removed inside one
 * synchronous task, so no render and no frame observes it, React does not
 * watch the DOM, and a `MutationObserver` sees the addition and the removal
 * together. `position: fixed` under a `transform`/`filter` ancestor only
 * changes which box it is fixed to, and an `overflow` ancestor only clips;
 * neither reaches the text serializer.
 *
 * The live selection is restored before returning, anchor and focus each to
 * the end it came from; the one `selectionchange` listener in the app
 * (`useComposerDraft`) ignores anchors outside the composer, and the event is
 * queued rather than dispatched mid-swap, so nothing observes the intermediate
