/**
 * Regression cover for the remaining half of issue #419.
 *
 * The public-network guard classifies the target host with a *local* resolver
 * while the request itself would travel through the configured proxy (ADR 0177,
 * ADR 0243), so a proxied or TUN user's local resolver can answer with a fake
 * address — Clash fake-IP in `198.18.0.0/15` — or with nothing at all. Only the
 * first is a verdict on an address. Collapsing both into one `policy` bucket let
 * the app tell users their catalog sources "were blocked by the app's address
 * check" when no address had ever been judged: that is the exact line the
 * reporter quoted.
 *
 * Nothing here changes *whether* the guard blocks. Every case below is still
 * refused, and the last test pins that. What is pinned is what the app says about
 * it — which host, and which of the two causes.
