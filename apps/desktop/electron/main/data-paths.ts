/**
 * The two directories that define an installation, and the development split
 * between them.
 *
 * A packaged PI-Desktop and a `pnpm dev` host used to share both: the
 * name-derived `userData` — where Electron keeps the single-instance lock,
 * renderer `localStorage`, and the plugin panel partitions — and
 * `~/.pi-desktop`, where host-core keeps `pi.sqlite` beside the persistence
 * outbox and the log tree. Sharing them meant a shipped app that was already
 * running held the lock, so the development launch quit on arrival; a
 * development host that won the race instead put a second host-core over the
 * same single-writer database, which is the divergence D236 exists to
 * prevent. Neither is workable while someone debugs against the app they use.
 *
 * Only the development side moves, and only these two names differ. A shipped
 * installation keeps `PI-Desktop` and `~/.pi-desktop`, so no upgrade relocates
 * a user's database, secrets, plugins, or renderer-local state, and
 * `PI_DESKTOP_DATA_DIR` still overrides either profile outright.
